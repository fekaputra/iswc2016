The main challenge in translating ontologies is to find the right term with respect to the domain modeled by ontology itself.
Machine translation services may help in this task; however, a crucial requirement is to have translations validated by experts before the ontologies are deployed.
Real-world applications must implement a support system addressing this task for relieve experts work in validating all translations.
In this paper, we present ESSOT, an Expert Supporting System for Ontology Translation.
The peculiarity of this system is to exploit semantic information of the concept's context for improving the quality of label translations.
The system has been tested both within the Organic.Lingua project by translating the modeled ontology in three languages and on other multilingual ontologies in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the system in other contexts.
The results have been compared with the translations provided by the Microsoft Translator API and the improvements demonstrated the viability of the proposed approach."

We report the use of SPARQL for two real data analytic use cases from the healthcare and life sciences domains, which exposed certain weaknesses in the current specification of SPARQL; specifically when the data being integrated is most conveniently accessed via RESTful services and in formats beyond RDF, such as XML. We therefore extended SPARQL with generalized 'service', constructs for accessing services beyond the SPARQL endpoints supported by 'service'; for efficiency, our constructs additionally needed to support posting data, which is also not supported by 'service'.   Furthermore, data from multiple sources led to natural modularity in the queries, with different portions of the query pertaining to different sources, so we also extended SPARQL with a simple 'function' mechanism to isolate the mechanics of accessing each endpoint.  We provide an open source implementation of this SPARQL endpoint in an RDF store called Quetzal, and evaluate its use in the two data analytic scenarios over real datasets."

Existing implementations for describing these system models exhibit a number of shortcomings regarding their approach to data management. In this emerging applications paper, we present the application of an ontology for space system design providing increased semantic soundness of the underlying standardized data specification, enabling reasoners to identify problems in the system, and allowing the application of operational knowledge collected over past projects to the system to be designed. Based on a qualitative evaluation driven by data derived from an actual satellite design project, a reflection on the applicability of ontologies in the overall model-based systems engineering approach is pursued."

The purpose of this study was to sustainably build Linked Open Data (LOD) for the illegally parked bicycles and to support the problem solving by raising social awareness, in cooperation with the Bureau of General Affairs of Tokyo. We first extracted information on the problem factors and designed LOD schema for illegally parked bicycles. Then we collected pieces of data from Social Networking Service (SNS) and websites of municipalities to build the illegally parked bicycle LOD (IPBLOD) with more than 200,000 triples. We then estimated the missing data in the LOD based on the causal relations from the problem factors. As a result, the number of illegally parked bicycles can be inferred with 70.9% accuracy. Finally, we published the complemented LOD and a Web application to visualize the distribution of illegally parked bicycles in the city. We hope this raises social attention on this issue."

The system is motivated by an industry use-case where Enterprise Data needs to be combined with a large body of Open Data to fulfill information needs not satisfied by prescribed application data models. Our proposed Question Answering pipeline combines existing components with novel methods to perform, in turn, linguistic analysis of a query, named entity extraction, entity / graph search, fusion and ranking of possible answers. We evaluate QuerioDALI with two open-domain benchmarks and a biomedical one over Linked Open Data sources, and show that our system produces comparable results to systems that require training data and are domain-dependent. In addition, we analyze the current challenges and shortcomings."

The 2015 Paris agreement on climate change emphasised the importance of raising public awareness and participation to address this societal challenge. In this paper we introduce EnergyUse; a social and collaborative platform for raising awareness on climate change, by enabling users to view and compare the actual energy consumption of various appliances, and to share and discuss energy conservation tips in an open and social environment. The platform collects data from smart plugs, and exports appliance consumption information and community generated energy tips as linked data. In this paper we report on the system design, data modelling, platform usage and early deployment with a set of 58 initial participants. We also discuss the challenges, lessons learnt, and future platform developments."

OBDA approach has a great potential to facilitate such tasks; however, it has a number of limitations in dealing with analytics that restrict its use in important industrial applications. Based on our experience with Siemens, we argue that in order to overcome those limitations OBDA should be extended and become analytics, source, and cost aware. In this work we propose such an extension. In particular, we propose an ontology, mapping, and query language for OBDA, where aggregate and other analytical functions are first class citizens. Moreover, we develop query optimisation techniques that allow to efficiently process analytical tasks over static and streaming data. We implement our approach in a system and evaluate our system with Siemens turbine data."

The declarative nature of these formalisms is close to natural language and human conceptualisation and thus Semantic Technologies enjoy increasing popularity in scenarios where traditional solutions lead to very convoluted procedures which are difficult to maintain and whose correctness is difficult to judge.
A fruitful application of Semantic Technologies in the field of health care data analysis has emerged from the collaboration between Oxford and Kaiser Permanente a US health care provider (HMO). US HMOs have to annually deliver measurement results on their quality of care to US authorities. One of these sets of measurements is defined in a specification called HEDIS which is infamous amongst data analysts for its complexity. Traditional solutions with either SAS-programs or SQL-queries lead to involved solutions whose maintenance and validation is difficult and binds considerable amount of resources.
In this paper we present the project in which we have applied Semantic Technologies to compute the most difficult part of the HEDIS measures. We show that we arrive at a clean, structured and legible encoding of HEDIS in the rule language of the RDF-triple store RDFox. We use RDFox's reasoning capabilities and SPARQL queries to compute and extract the results. The results of a whole Kaiser Permanente regional branch could be computed in competitive time by RDFox on readily available commodity hardware. Further development and deployment of the project results are envisaged in Kaiser Permanente."

However, this process is typically carried out manually by expert editors, leading to high costs and slow throughput. In this paper we present Smart Topic Miner (STM), a novel solution which uses semantic web technologies to classify scholarly publications on the basis of a very large automatically generated ontology of research areas. STM was developed to support the Springer Nature Computer Science editorial team in classifying proceedings in the LNCS family. It analyses in real time a set of publications provided by an editor and produces a structured set of topics and a number of Springer Nature classification tags, which best characterise the given input. In this paper we present the architecture of the system and report on an evaluation study conducted with a team of Springer Nature editors. The results of the evaluation, which showed that STM classifies publications with a high degree of accuracy, are very encouraging and as a result we are currently discussing the required next steps to ensure large scale deployment within the company."

Ontologies are mainly used in Siemens to capture the conceptual information models underpinning a wide range of applications. We start by describing the key role that such models play in two use cases in the manufacturing and energy production sectors. Then, we discuss the formalisation of information models using ontologies, and the relevant reasoning services. Finally, we present SOMM---a tool that supports engineers with little background on semantic technologies in the creation of ontology-based models and in populating them with data. SOMM implements a fragment of OWL 2 RL extended with a form of integrity constraints for data validation, and it comes with support for schema and data reasoning, as well as for model integration. Our evaluation demonstrates the adequacy of SOMM's functionality and performance for Siemens applications."

However, enterprise information is scattered in different databases and websites. The information from a single source is incomplete and also suffers from noise. It is not an easy task to integrate and utilize information from diverse sources in real business scenarios. In this paper, we present an approach to build knowledge graphs (KGs) by exploiting semantic technologies to reconcile the data from diverse sources incrementally. We build a national-wide enterprise KG which incorporates information about 40,000,000 enterprises in China. We also provide querying about enterprises and data visualization capabilities as well as novel investment analysis scenarios, including finding an enterprise's real controllers, innovative enterprise analysis, enterprise path discovery and so on. The KG and its applications are currently used by two security companies in their investment banking businesses."

Currently, the taxonomy classes that are relevant in terms of profit generation and difficulty of exploration are being manually extended with data properties deemed helpful to create pages that improve the user search experience and ultimately the conversion rate. In this paper we present a scalable approach that aims to automate this process, automatically selecting the relevant and semantically homogenous subtrees in the taxonomy, extracting from semi-structured text in items descriptions a core set of properties and a popular subset of their ranges, then ex- tending the covered range using relational similarities in free text. Additionally, our process automatically tags the items with the new semantic information and exposes them as RDF triples. We present a set of experiments showing the effectiveness of our approach in this business context."

which proposes an uniform view on all interfaces to rdf. This reveals a complete
spectrum between Linked Data documents and the sparql protocol, in which
we can advance the state-of-the-art of Linked Data publishing. This axis can be
explored in the following two dimensions: i) Selector, allowing different, more
complex questions for the server; and ii) Metadata, extending the response
with more information clients can use.
This work studies the second Metadata dimension in a practical Web context.
Considering the conditions on the Web, this problem becomes three-fold. First,
analog to the Web itself, ldf interfaces should exist in a distributed, scalable
manner in order to succeed. Generating additional metadata introduces overhead
on the server, which influences the ability to scale towards multiple clients. Second,
the communication between client and server uses the http protocol. Modeling,
serialization, and compression determine the extra load the overall network traffic.
Third, with query execution on the client, novel approaches need to apply this
metadata intelligently to increase efficiency.
Concretely, this work defines and evaluates a series of transparent, interchangeable,
and discoverable interface features. We proposed Triple Pattern Fragments, a Linked Data api with low-server cost, as a fundamental base . This
interface uses a single triple pattern as selector. To explore this research space,
we append this interface with different metadata, starting with an estimated
number of total matching triples. By combining several tpfs, sparql queries are
evaluated on the client-side, using the metadata for optimization. Hence, we can
measure the query execution"

Mining reachability relationships between entities is an important task for extracting knowledge from LOD. Diverse labeling schemes have been proposed to efficiently determine the reachability. We focus on a state-of-the-art 2-hop labeling scheme that is based on a permutation of vertices to achieve a linear index size and reduce on-line searches that are required when the reachability cannot be answered by 2-hop labels only. We observed that the approach can be improved in three different ways; 1) space-efficiency - guarantee the minimized index size without randomness 2) update-efficiency - update labels efficiently when graphs changes 3) parallelization - labeling should be cluster-based, and solved in a distributed fashion. In these regards, this PhD thesis proposes optimization techniques that address these issues. In this paper in particular, a way of reducing the 2-hop label size is proposed with preliminary results on real-world DAG datasets. In addition, we will discuss the feasibilities of the other issues based on our on-going works."

This comes at the price of designing high throughput, low latency, fault tolerant, highly available and scalable engines. The cost of implementing such systems from scratch is very high and usually one prefers to program components on top of a framework that possesses these properties, e.g., Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark. The research conducting in this PhD adopts this approach and aims to create a production-ready RSP engine which will be based on domain standards, e.g., Apache Kafka and Spark Streaming. In a nutshell, the engine aims to i) address basic event modeling - to guarantee the completeness of input data in window operators, ii) process real-time RDF stream in a distributed manner - efficient RDF stream handling is required; iii) support and extend common continuous SPARQL syntax - easy-to-use, adapt to the industrial needs and iv) support reasoning services at both the data preparation and query processing levels."

For this background, ontology construction and refinement costs a lot of time and ef-fort. In order to reduce such costs, we develop an ontology refinement support system. This system have two main function. First, the system can detect points that should be refined and propose how to refine it. Second, the system can evaluate ontologies quantitatively. This system indicate how ontologies are consistent in a classificatory criterion. To develop the refinement support system, we focus on a guideline for building well-organized ontologies that “Each subclass of a super class is distinguished by the values of exactly one attribute of the super class”. When an ontology is built following this guideline, there is similarity among Is-a hierarchies. We use these similar Is-a hierarchies and develop an ontology refinement system."

Currently, it comprises a large compendium of interlinked and distributed datasets from multiple domains. Running complex queries on this compendium often requires accessing data from different endpoints within one query. The abundance of datasets and the need for running complex query has thus motivated a considerable body of work on SPARQL query federation systems, the dedicated means to access data distributed over the Web of Data. However, the granularity of previous evaluations of such systems has not allowed deriving of insights concerning their behavior in different steps involved during federated query processing. In this work, we perform extensive experiments to compare state-of-the-art SPARQL endpoint federation systems using the comprehensive performance evaluation framework FedBench. In addition to considering the tradition query runtime as an evaluation criterion, we extend the scope of our performance evaluation by considering criteria, which have not been paid much attention to in previous studies. In particular, we consider the number of sources selected, the total number of SPARQL ASK requests used, the completeness of answers as well as the source selection time. Yet, we show that they have a significant impact on the overall query runtime of existing systems. Moreover, we extend FedBench to mirror a highly distributed data environment and assess the behavior of existing systems by using the same performance criteria. As the result we provide a detailed analysis of the experimental outcomes that reveal novel insights for improving current and future SPARQL federation systems."

Though the importance of aesthetics in affecting the usability, effectiveness and acceptability of user interfaces have long been recognised, little or no explicit attention has been paid to the aesthetics of Linked Data applications. In this paper, we introduce a formalised approach to developing aesthetically pleasing semantic web interfaces by following aesthetic principles and guidelines identified from literature. We apply such principles to design and develop a generic approach of using visualizations to support exploration of Linked Data, in an interface that is pleasing to users. This provides users with means to browse ontology structures, enriched with statistics of the underlying data, facilitating exploratory activities and enabling visual query for highly precise information needs. We evaluated our approach in three ways: an initial objective evaluation comparing our approach with other well-known interfaces for the semantic web and two user evaluations with semantic web researchers."

In this paper, we present a method and tools to automatically build knowledge graphs from news articles. As news articles describe changes in the world through the events they report, we present an approach to create Event-Centric Knowledge Graphs (ECKGs) using state-of-the-art natural language processing and semantic web techniques. Such ECKGs capture long-term developments and histories on hundreds of thousands of entities and are complementary to the static encyclopedic information in traditional knowledge graphs. We describe our event-centric representation schema, the challenges in extracting event information from news, our open source pipeline, and the knowledge graphs we have extracted from four different news corpora: general news (Wikinews), the FIFA world cup, the Global Automotive Industry, and Airbus A380 airplanes. Furthermore, we present an assessment on the accuracy of the pipeline in extracting the triples of the knowledge graphs. Moreover, through an event-centered browser and visualization tool we show how approaching information from news in an event-centric manner can increase the user’s understanding of the domain, facilitates the reconstruction of news story lines, and enable to perform exploratory investigation of news hidden facts."""

So far, this task is often addressed by human curators in a three-step process: issuing appropriate keyword queries for the statement to check using standard search engines, retrieving potentially relevant documents and screening those documents for relevant content. The drawbacks of this process are manifold. Most importantly, it is very time-consuming as the experts have to carry out several search processes and must often read several documents. In this article, we present DeFacto (Deep Fact Validation)—an algorithm able to validate facts by finding trustworthy sources for them on the Web. DeFacto aims to provide an effective way of validating facts by supplying the user with relevant excerpts of web pages as well as useful additional information including a score for the confidence DeFacto has in the correctness of the input fact. To achieve this goal, DeFacto collects and combines evidence from web pages written in several languages. In addition, DeFacto provides support for facts with a temporal scope, i.e., it can estimate in which time frame a fact was valid. Given that the automatic evaluation of facts has not been paid much attention to so far, generic benchmarks for evaluating these frameworks were not previously available. We thus also present a generic evaluation framework for fact checking and make it publicly available."

The key task in ontology localization is translating the lexical layer of an ontology, i.e., its labels, into some foreign language. For this task, we hypothesize that the translation quality can be improved by adapting a machine translation system to the domain of the ontology. To this end, we build on the success of existing statistical machine translation (SMT) approaches, and investigate the impact of different domain adaptation techniques on the task. In particular, we investigate three techniques: (i) enriching a phrase table by domain-specific translation candidates acquired from existing Web resources, (ii) relying on Explicit Semantic Analysis as an additional technique for scoring a certain translation of a given source phrase, as well as (iii) adaptation of the language model by means of weighting n-grams with scores obtained from topic modelling. We present in detail the impact of each of these three techniques on the task of translating ontology labels. We show that these techniques have a generally positive effect on the quality of translation of the ontology and that, in combination, they provide a significant improvement in quality. "

Faceted search is the de facto approach for exploratory search in many online applications, and has been recently proposed as a suitable paradigm for querying RDF repositories. In this paper, we provide rigorous theoretical underpinnings for faceted search in the context of RDF-based knowledge graphs enhanced with OWL 2 ontologies. We identify well-defined fragments of SPARQL that can be naturally captured using faceted search as a query paradigm, and establish the computational complexity of answering such queries. We also study the problem of updating faceted interfaces, which is critical for guiding users in the formulation of meaningful queries during exploratory search. We have implemented our approach in a fully-fledged faceted search system, SemFacet, which we have evaluated over the Yago knowledge graph."

Key features of Ontop are its solid theoretical foundations, a virtual approach to OBDA, which avoids materializing triples and is implemented through the query rewriting technique, extensive optimizations exploiting all elements of the OBDA architecture, its compliance to all relevant W3C recommendations (including SPARQL queries, R2RML mappings, and OWL 2 QL and RDFS ontologies), and its support for all major relational databases."

To avoid inefficient re-evaluations of already evaluated parts of a stream in respect to a query, incremental evaluation strategies are applied, i.e., the query results are obtained incrementally from the result set of the preceding processing state without having to re-evaluate all input buffers. This method is highly efficient but it comes at the cost of having to maintain processing state, which is not trivial, and may defeat performance advantages of the incremental evaluation strategy. In the context of RDF streams the problem is further aggravated by the hard-to-predict evolution of the structure of RDF graphs over time and the application of sub-optimal implementation approaches, e.g., using relational technologies for storing data and processing states which incur significant performance drawbacks for graph-based query patterns. To address these performance problems, this paper proposes a set of novel operator-aware data structures coupled with incremental evaluation algorithms which outperform the counterparts of relational stream processing systems. This claim is demonstrated through extensive experimental results on both simulated and real datasets."

However, we observe widely varying data quality ranging from extensively curated datasets to crowdsourced and extracted data of relatively low quality. In this article, we present the results of a systematic review of approaches for assessing the quality of LD. We gather existing approaches and analyze them qualitatively. In particular, we unify and formalize commonly used terminologies across papers related to data quality and provide a comprehensive list of 18 quality dimensions and 69 metrics. Additionally, we qualitatively analyze the 30 core approaches and 12 tools using a set of attributes. The aim of this article is to provide researchers and data curators a comprehensive understanding of existing work, thereby encouraging further experimentation and development of new approaches focused towards data quality, specifically for LD."

This makes it interesting to create ontology based, user-oriented tools for searching and exploring this data. Although initial efforts were intended for tech users with knowledge of SPARQL/RDF, there are ongoing proposals designed for lay users. One of the most promising approaches is to use visual query interfaces, but more user studies are needed to assess their effectiveness. In this paper, we compare the effect on usability of two important paradigms for ontology-based query interfaces: form-based and graph-based interfaces. In order to reduce the number of variables affecting the comparison, we performed a user study with two state-of-the-art query tools developed by ourselves, sharing a large part of the code base: the graph-based tool OptiqueVQS*, and the form-based tool PepeSearch. We evaluated these tools in a formal comparison study with 15 participants searching a Linked Open Data version of the Norwegian Company Registry. Participants had to respond to 6 non-trivial search tasks using alternately OptiqueVQS* and PepeSearch. Even without previous training, retrieval performance and user confidence were very high, thus suggesting that both interface designs are effective for searching RDF datasets. Expert searchers had a clear preference for the graph-based interface, and mainstream searchers obtained better performance and confidence with the form-based interface. While a number of participants spontaneously praised the capability of the graph interface for composing complex queries, our results evidence that graph interfaces are difficult to grasp. In contrast, form interfaces are more learnable and relieve problems with disorientation for mainstream users. We have also observed positive results introducing faceted search and dynamic term suggestion in semantic search interfaces."

  search results is challenging because it requires successfully automating a number
  of complex subtasks, such as structure inference and matching of
  both instances and concepts, each of which gives rise to uncertain
  outcomes. Such uncertainty is unavoidable given the semantically heterogeneous
  nature of web sources, including LD ones. This paper approaches the problem of 
  structuring LD search results as an evidence-based one. In particular, the paper shows 
  how one formalism (viz., probabilistic soft logic (PSL)) can be exploited to assimilate
  different sources of evidence in a principled way and to beneficial
  effect for users. The paper considers syntactic evidence derived from matching
  algorithms, semantic evidence derived from LD vocabularies, and user
  evidence, in the form of feedback. The main contributions are: sets 
  of PSL rules that model the uniform assimilation of diverse kinds of evidence, 
  an empirical evaluation of how the resulting PSL programs perform in terms 
  of their ability to infer structure in LD search results, and, finally, a concrete
  example of how populating such inferred structures for presentation
  to the end user is beneficial, besides enabling the collection of
  feedback whose assimilation further improves search result presentation."

Existing non-semantic risk prediction tools are typically based on hardcoded scientific knowledge, and only cover a very limited range of patient states. This makes them rapidly out of date, and limited in application, particularly for patients with co-morbidities (multiple co-occurring conditions). Semantic Web and Quantified Self technologies make it possible to address this task in a much more principled way, to maximise knowledge and data reuse and minimise maintenance requirements while enabling new and sophisticated applications involving widely-available biometric sensors. 

We present a framework for calculating clinical risk predictions for patients based on automatically-gathered biometric data. This framework relies on generic, reusable ontologies for representing clinical risk, and sensor readings, and reasoning to support the integration of data represented according to these ontologies. This integration makes novel use of Semantic Web technologies, and supports straightforward extension and maintenance by medical professionals. The framework is evaluated in terms of its predictions, extensibility and ease of use for domain experts."

The challenge here is therefore the design of a cost-function that is able to detect the strongest relationship between two given entities, by objectively assessing the value of a given path. To achieve this, we use a Genetic Programming approach in a supervised learning method to generate path evaluation functions that compare well with human evaluations. We show how such a cost-function can be generated only using basic topological features of the nodes of the paths as they are being traversed (i.e. without knowledge of the whole graph), and how it can be improved through introducing a very small amount of knowledge about the vocabularies of the properties that connect nodes in the graph."

The latter has traditionally been termed 'Social Meaning', a

studied by the Semantic Web community.

In this paper we use statistical model learning as a method to
quantify the meaning that is (at least) encoded in Semantic Web
names, We implement the approach and evaluate it over hundreds of
thousands of data sets in order to illustrate its efficacy.  Our
experiments confirm that many Semantic Web names are indeed
meaningful and, more interestingly, we provide a quantitative

In these applications, one query pattern is especially prominent: a join between a continuous data stream and some background data (BGD). Oftentimes, the target BGD is large, maintained externally, changing slowly, and costly to query (both in terms of time and money). Hence, practical applications usually maintain a local (cached) view of the relevant BGD. Given that these caches are not updated as part of the transaction modifying the original BGD, they should be maintained under realistic budget constraints (in terms of latency, computation time, and possibly financial cost) to avoid stale data leading to wrong answers. 

This paper proposes to model the join between streams and the BGD as a bipartite graph. By exploiting the graph structure, we keep the quality of results good enough without refreshing the entire cache for each evaluation. We also introduce two extensions to this method: first, we consider both the sliding window (specifying the currently relevant section of the data stream) and the change rate of the BGD to focus on updates that have the longest effect. Second, by considering the future impact of a query to the BGD we propose to sometimes delay updates to provide more fresher answers in future.

Using an implemented system we empirically show that we can improve result freshness by 93% over baseline algorithms such as Random Selection or Least Recently Updated."

In this paper we investigate how computers and in particular RDF stores can take advantage from this emergent schema to more compactly store RDF data and more efficiently optimize and execute SPARQL queries. To this end, we contribute techniques for efficient emergent schema aware RDF storage and new query operator algorithms for emergent schema aware scans and joins.

A particularly interesting approach is traversal-based query execution which fetches data by traversing data links and, thus, is able to make use of up-to-date data from initially unknown data sources. While the downside of this approach is the delay before the query engine completes a query execution, user perceived response time may be improved significantly by returning as many elements of the result set as soon as possible. To this end, the query engine requires a traversal strategy that enables the engine to fetch result-relevant data as early as possible. The challenge for such a strategy is that the query engine does not know a priori what data sources will be discovered during the query execution and which of them contain result-relevant data. In this paper, we investigate 14 different approaches to rank traversal steps and achieve a variety of traversal strategies. We experimentally study their impact on response times and compare them to a baseline that resembles a breadth-first traversal. While our experiments show that some of the approaches can achieve noteworthy improvements over the baseline in a significant number of cases, we also observe that for every approach, there is a non-negligible chance to achieve response times that are worse than the baseline."

However, materialized view techniques, as proposed in relational databases, do not support RDF specifics, such as incompleteness and the need to support implicit (derived) information. Therefore, to overcome these challenges, this paper proposes MARVEL – the approach consisting of a view selection algorithm based on an RDF-specific cost model, a view definition syntax. and an algorithm for rewriting SPARQL queries using materialized RDF views. The experimental evaluation shows that the approach can improve query response time by more than an order of magnitude and is able to efficiently handle RDF specifics."

Since user activities can be represented in terms of re- lationships involving three or more things (e.g. a user tags movie items on a webpage), they can be represented as a tensor. The recent semantic sensitive tensor factorization (SSTF) is promising since it achieves high accuracies in predicting users’ activities by applying semantics behind objects (e.g. item categories) to tensor factorization. However, SSTF fo- cuses on the factorization of data logs from a single service and thus has two problems: (1) the balance problem caused when simultaneously han- dling heterogeneous datasets and (2) the sparcity problem caused when there are insufficient data logs within a single service. Our solution, Se- mantic Sensitive Simultaneous Tensor Factorization (S3TF), tackles the above problems by: (1) It creates tensors for individual services and fac- torizes those tensors simultaneously; it does not force to create a tensor from multiple services and factorize the single tensor. This avoids low prediction results caused by the balance problem. (2) It utilizes shared semantics behind distributed logs and gives semantic biases to each ten- sor factorization. This avoids the sparsity problem by using the shared se- mantics among services. Experiments using the real-world datasets show that S3TF achieves up to 13% higher accuracy in rating predictions than the current best tensor method. It also extracts implicit relationships across services in the feature spaces by simultaneouse factorization."

Previous approaches use machine learning to learn a model that extracts features related to the data of a domain, which requires the model to be re-trained for every new domain. Our solution uses similarity metrics as features to compare against labeled domain data and learns a matching function to infer the correct semantic labels for data. Since our approach depends on the learned similarity metrics but not the data itself, it is domain-independent and only needs to be trained once to work effectively across multiple domains. In our evaluation, our approach achieves higher accuracy than other approaches, even when the learned models are trained on domains other than the test domain."

In this paper, we present RDF2Vec, an approach that uses language modeling approaches for unsupervised feature extraction from sequences of words, and adapts them to RDF graphs. We generate sequences by leveraging local information from graph sub-structures, harvested by Weisfeiler-Lehman Subtree RDF Graph Kernels and graph walks, and learn latent numerical representations of entities in RDF graphs. Our evaluation shows that such vector representations outperform existing techniques for the propositionalization of RDF graphs on a variety of different predictive machine learning tasks, and that feature vector representations of general knowledge graphs such as DBpedia and Wikidata can be easily reused for different tasks."

In this paper, we describe an optimisation to the SPARQL-to-SQL approach, based on a study of time-series IoT data structures, that employs metadata abstraction and efficient translation by reusing existing SPARQL engines to produce Linked Data `just-in-time'. We evaluate our approach against RDF stores, state-of-the-art SPARQL-to-SQL engines and streaming SPARQL engines, in the context of IoT data and scenarios.

However, Horn rules do not take into account possible exceptions, so that predicting facts via such rules introduces errors. 
To overcome this problem,  we present a method for effective revision of learned Horn rules by effectively incorporating exceptions (i.e., negated atoms) into their bodies. This way errors are largely reduced. We apply our method to discover rules with exceptions from real-world KGs. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method and the improvements in accuracy for KG completion by rule-based fact prediction."

We present a novel approach to automatically discover the semantic relations within a given data source. We mine the small graph patterns occurring in Linked Open Data and combine them to build a graph that will be used to infer semantic relations. We evaluated our approach on datasets from different domains.

At the same time it is well-understood that relational queries are not enough to cope with graph-structured data, where one is interested in expressing queries that capture navigation in the graph. This paper contributes a study on the problem of query containment for an expressive class of navigational queries called Extended Property Paths (EPPs). EPPs are more expressive than previous navigational extensions of SPARQL like property paths and nested regular expressions, for which containment has already been studied. We attack the problem of EPPs (and SPARQL with EPPs) containment and provide complexity bounds.

Another trend in the area of information retrieval (IR) is to take temporal aspects of a given query into account when assessing the relevance of documents. However, while this has become an established functionality in document search engines, the significance of time, especially when explicitly given, has not been recognized for entity recommendation, yet. We address this gap by introducing the task of time-aware entity recommendation. We propose the first probabilistic model that takes time-awareness into consideration for entity recommendation by leveraging heterogeneous knowledge of entities extracted from different data sources publicly available on the Web.

It is known that regular expressions have limited expressivity; for instance, some natural queries, like same generations-queries} are not expressible with regular expressions. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we present cfSPARQL, an extension of SPARQL query language equipped with context-free grammars. The cfSPARQL language is strictly more expressive than property paths and nested expressions. The additional expressivity can be used for modelling graph similarities, graph summarization and ontology alignment.

In an effort to develop a sembank (i.e., an annotated corpus dedicated to capturing the semantic meaning of a large set of annotated sentences), NLP researchers have developed the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) formulation. Each AMR is a rooted, labeled graph that represents the semantics of a single sentence. Nodes in the core AMR graph represent concepts/entities (such as nouns, PropBank frames, etc.) and edges represent relations between concepts, (such a frame-specific arguments, roles, etc.). AMRs have been used to annotate corpora of classic books, newstext and the biomedical research literature. Research is progressing on creating automatic parsers to generate AMRs directly from textual input. In the work described here, we map the AMR representation to a linked data format (AMR-LD), adopting the ontological formulation of the underlying AMR faithfully. We describe the process of generating AMR-LD data from standard AMRs derived from biomedical research articles, including mapping named entities to well-known linked-data resources, such as Uniprot and PubChem, as well as an open-source software to convert AMR data to RDF. We describe the benefits of AMR-LD, including convenient analysis using SPARQL queries and ontology inferences, and embedding into the web of Linked Data. Finally, we discuss the possible impact of semantic web representations that are directly derived from natural language."

Systematically deployed on the Internet of Things (IoT), they would be able to form complete energy consuming, producing, and managing ecosystems. Smart systems are technically very heterogeneous, and standardized interfaces on a sensor and device level are therefore needed. However, standardization in IoT has largely focused at the technical communication level, leading to a large number of different solutions based on various standards and protocols, with limited attention to the common semantics contained in the message data structures exchanged at the technical level. The Smart Appliance REFerence ontology (SAREF) is a shared model of consensus developed in close interaction with the industry and with the support of the European Commission. It is published as a technical specification by ETSI and provides an important contribution to achieve semantic interoperability for smart appliances. This paper builds on the success achieved in standardizing SAREF and presents SAREF4EE, an extension of SAREF. SAREF4EE has been created in collaboration with the EEBus and Energy@Home industry associations to interconnect their (different) data models. By using SAREF4EE, smart appliances from different manufacturers that support the EEBus or Energy@Home standards can easily communicate with each other using any energy management system at home or in the cloud."

In order to make integrated decisions, it is necessary to combine the knowledge and expertise in multiple areas, such as roads, soil, buried assets, sensing, etc. This requires an underpinning knowledge model, in the form of an ontology. Within this context, we present a new ontology for describing soil properties (e.g. soil strength) and processes (e.g. soil compaction), as well as how they affect each other.

In addition, we present the process carried out for producing and publishing a LOD dataset containing data extracted from existing Italian policy documents on such products and compliant with the aforementioned ontologies."

The project combines information from 10 Wikipedias of different languages, thus giving the knowledge a multilingual dimension. It also attaches spatial and temporal information to many facts, and thus allows the user to query the data over space and time. YAGO focuses on extraction quality and achieves a manually evaluated precision of 95%. In this paper, we explain from a general perspective how YAGO is built from its sources, how its quality is evaluated, how a user can access it, and how other projects utilize it."

However, no extensive comparisons between those approaches have been undertaken, in particular due to a lack of publicly available, acknowledged benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present a collection of 22 benchmark datasets at different sizes, derived from existing Semantic Web datasets as well as from external classification and regression problems linked to datasets in the Linked Open Data cloud. Such a collection of datasets can be used to conduct qualitative performance testing and systematic comparisons of approaches."

This requires new combined data and software engineering processes and tools. Semantic metadata standards such as RDFS and OWL, and linked data principles, provide a technical grounding for such integrated systems given an appropriate model of the domain. In this paper we introduce the ALIGNED suite of ontologies or vocabularies specifically designed to model the information exchange needs of combined software and data engineering processes. The models have been deployed to enable: tool-chain integration, such as the exchange of data quality reports; cross-domain communication, such as interlinked data and software unit testing; mediation of the system design process through the capture of design intents and as a source of context for model-driven software engineering processes. These ontologies are deployed in trial live web-scale, data-intensive system development environments in both the commercial and academic domains. We exemplify the usage of the suite on a complex collaborative software and data engineering scenario from the legal information system domain."

We highlight some differences between the results obtained by the top systems and the ones we are able to compute. We also propose SentiME, an ensemble system composed of 5 state-of-the-art sentiment classifiers. SentiME first trains the different classifiers using the Bootstrap Aggregating Algorithm. The classification results are then aggregated using a linear function that averages the classification distributions of the different classifiers. SentiME has also been tested over the SemEval2015 test set, properly trained with the SemEval2015 train test, outperforming the best ranked system of the challenge. "

It can thus happen that the same entity is both described by using schema.org annotations and by creating a text anchor pointing to its Wikipedia page. Often, those representations provide complementary information which is not exploited since those entities are disjoint.

In this project, we explore the extent to which entities represented in different ways repeat on the Web, how they are related, and how they complement (or link) to each other. Our initial experiments show that we can unveil a previously (unexploited) knowledge graph by applying simple instance matching techniques on a large collection of schema.org annotations and DBpedia. The resulting knowledge graph aggregates entities (often tail entities) scattered across several Web pages, and complements existing DBpedia entities with new facts and properties.

In order to facilitate further investigations in how to mine such information, we are releasing i) an excerpt of all CommonCrawl web pages containing both Wikipedia and schema.org annotations, ii) the toolset to extract this information and perform knowledge graph construction and mapping onto DBpedia, as well as iii) the resulting knowledge graph (VoldemortKG) obtained via label matching techniques."

However, in comparison to English and other prominent languages, the presence of Chinese in such a cloud is still limited, despite the fact that Chinese is the most spoken language worldwide. Publishing more Chinese language resources in the LLOD cloud can benefit both academia and industry to better understand the language itself and to further build multilingual applications that will improve the flow of data and services across countries. In this paper, we describe Zhishi.lemon, a newly developed dataset based on the lemon model that constitutes the lexical realization of Zhishi.me, one of the largest Chinese datasets in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud. Zhishi.lemon combines the lemon core with the lemon translation module in order to build a linked data lexicon in Chinese with translations into Spanish and English. Links to BabelNet (a vast multilingual encyclopedic resource) have been provided as well. We also present a showcase of this module along with the technical details of transforming Zhishi.me to Zhishi.lemon. We have made the dataset accessible on the Web for both humans (via a Web interface) and software agents (with a SPARQL endpoint)."

We discuss important conceptualisations of different abstraction layers, their necessity to successfully model audio effects, and their application method. We present use cases concerning the application of effects in music production projects, and the creation of audio effect metadata facilitating a linked data service exposing information about effect implementations. By doing so, we show how our model benefits knowledge sharing, and enables reproducibility and analysis of audio production workflows."
