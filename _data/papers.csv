poster_94,94,Motoyuki Takaai and Yohei Yamane,Takaai,Constructing Semantic Networks of Development Activities from Weekly Reports,poster,Poster and Demo session,16,Motoyuki Takaai,poster_94.pdf,3rd Floor,2016-10-19T18:00:00,2016-10-19T21:00:00,"In the development departments of some manufacturing companies,
there are weekly reports describing the status of events but they are poorly structured plain texts.
In this report, we propose a method for constructing semantic networks of development activities from weekly reports.
Our ontology-based method extracts things like events, status and agents from the reports and constructs relations
between them and creates Semantic MediaWiki pages from the semantic networks to visualize development activities.
We show a use case to apply the method to actual weekly reports and internal documents of a development department."

We have first developed the DOREMUS ontology which is an extension of the well-known FRBRoo model for describing works and expressions as well as the creation processus. We have implemented a so-called marc2rdf tool allowing for the conversion and linking of bibliographical entries about music works, interpretations and expressions from their original MARC-format to RDF following this DOREMUS ontology. We present an exploratory search engine prototype that enables to browse through the reconciled collection of bibliographical records of classical music and to highlight the various interpretations of a work, its derivative, its performance casting as well as other rich metadata."

LIXR is based on domain-specific language embedded into the Scala programming language. It supports the definition of transformations of datasets from RDF to XML in a declarative fashion, while still maintaining the flexibility of a full programming language environment. We directly compare this system to other systems programmed in Java and XSLT and show that the LIXR implementations are significantly shorter in terms of lines of code, in addition to being bidirectional and conceptually simple to understand.

Data scaling is a relatively recent approach, proposed in the database community, that allows for quickly scaling an input data instance to s times its size, while preserving certain application-specific characteristics. The advantages of scaling are that the generator is general, in the sense that it can be re-used on different database schemas, and that users are not required to manually input the data characteristics. VIG lifts the scaling approach from the database level to the OBDA level, where the domain information of ontologies and mappings has to be taken into account as well.
 To evaluate the quality of VIG, in this paper we use it to generate data for the Berlin SPARQL Benchmark (BSBM), and compare it with the official BSBM data generator."

In this paper, we propose a unified interface for optimizing a continuous query in heterogeneous RSP systems. To enhance the performance of RSP, the unified interface decomposes query, reassembles partial queries and assigns them to appropriate RSP systems. Experimental results show that the proposed approach performances better in terms of memory consumption and latency."

The DBpedia dataset, which derives from Wikipedia infoboxes, is no exception. To mitigate the violations, we proposed in previous work to validate the mappings which generate the data, instead of validating the generated data afterwards. In this work, we demonstrate how mappings validation is applied to DBpedia. DBpedia mappings are automatically translated to RML and validated by RDFUnit. The DBpedia mappings assessment can be frequently executed, because it requires significantly less time compared to validating the dataset. The validation results become available via a user-friendly interface. The DBpedia community considers them to refine the DBpedia mappings or ontology and thus, increase the dataset quality."

On top of this graph, we do evidence query and evidence fusion to generate the ranking list of decision options. Our prototype implementation of the evidence graph demonstrates its assistance to decision making, by combining a variety of knowledge-driven and data-driven decision services."

We manually design a new geography ontology to categorize a wide range of physical and human geographical entities, and carry out an automatic discovery of links to existing knowledge bases. The resulted Clinga dataset contains over half million Chinese geographical entities and is open access."

To address this, we present WebBrain, a new approach for harvesting commonsense knowledge that relies on joint learning from Web-scale data to fill gaps in the knowledge acquisition. We train a neural network model that not only learns word2vec-style vector representations of words but also commonsense knowledge about them. This joint model allows general semantic information to aid in generalizing beyond the extracted commonsense relationships. Experiments show that we can obtain word embeddings that reflect word meanings, yet also allow us to capture conceptual relationships and commonsense knowledge about them."

But while it has been easy to assess the systems' computational efficiency, it has been much harder to assess how well different semantic systems help their users find and browse information. In this article, we propose and demonstrate the use of a benchmark for evaluating them, similar to the TREC benchmark for evaluating traditional search engines. Our benchmark includes a set of typical user tasks and a well-defined procedure for assigning a measure of performance on those tasks to a semantic system. We demonstrate its application to one such system, Rhizomer. We intend for this work to initiate a community conversation that will lead to a general accepted framework for comparing systems and measuring, and thus encouraging, progress towards better semantic search and exploration tools."

Most of the work on automatically mapping structured and semi-structured sources to ontologies focuses on semantic labeling, i.e., annotating data fields with ontology classes and/or properties. However, a precise mapping that fully recovers the intended meaning of the data needs to describe the semantic relations between the data fields too. We present a novel approach to automatically discover the semantic relations within a given data source. We mine the small graph patterns occurring in Linked Open Data and combine them to build a graph that will be used to infer semantic relations. We evaluated our approach on datasets from different domains. Mining patterns of maximum length five, our method achieves an average precision of 75% and recall of 77% for a dataset with very complex mappings to the domain ontology, increasing up to 86% and 82%, respectively, for simpler ontologies and mappings."

For this reason, we present ESSOT, an Expert Supporting System for Ontology Translation, which support experts in accomplishing the multilingual ontology management task. Differently than the classic document translation, ontology label translation faces highly specific vocabulary and lack contextual information. 
Therefore, ESSOT takes advantage of the semantic information of the ontology for translation improvement of the ontology labels."

In particular we focus on formula based approaches to ABox insertion and deletion. We show that DL-LiteA, which is well known for enjoying first-order rewritability of query answering, enjoys a first-order rewritability property also for updates. That is, every update can be reformulated into a set of insertion and deletion instructions computable through a non-recursive DATALOG program. Such a program is readily translatable into a first-order query over the ABox considered as a database, and hence into SQL. Exploiting this result we implement an update component for DL-LiteA-based systems and perform some experiments showing that the approach works in practice."

In Japan, the government recently published a dataset covering approximately 4.4 million corporations, but the dataset is rated as 3 star in the 5-star rating system. Our policy, which we believe is also common in the LOD community, is that low-star datasets must be converted into 5 star as early as possible for strengthening the power of LOD. Based on this policy, we designed a schema for corporation data, converted the Japanese dataset into 5 star using this schema, and published this dataset under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License on 9th December 2015, only eight days after the publication date of the original dataset. As far as we know, eight datasets currently refer to ours, which makes the degree of 5 star stronger.

Often they are overwhelmed with an overflow of information while sometimes the presented information is too scarce to make any use of it. Without further knowledge about the context or background of the intended subject users are easily frustrated because they either cannot handle the amount of information or they might give up because they cannot make sense of the topic at all. Furthermore, authors of online-platforms often deal with the issue to provide useful recommendations of other articles and to motivate the readers to stay on the platform to explore more of the available but most times hidden content of their blog or archive.
In the demo presentation, we present refer, a semantic annotation and visualization system integrated into the Wordpress platform. With refer, content creators are enabled to (semi-)automatically annotate their texts with DBpedia resources as part of the original writing process and visualize them automatically. With refer users are encouraged to take an active part in discovering a platform’s information content interactively and intuitively, rather than just to have to read the entire textual information provided by the author. They can discover background information as well as relationships among persons, places, events, and anything related to the subject in current focus and are inspired to navigate the previously hidden information on a platform.

The declarative nature of these formalisms is close to natural language and human conceptualisation and thus Semantic Technologies enjoy increasing popularity in scenarios where traditional solutions lead to very convoluted procedures which are difficult to maintain and whose correctness is difficult to judge.
A fruitful application of Semantic Technologies in the field of health care data analysis has emerged from the collaboration between Oxford and Kaiser Permanente a US health care provider (HMO). US HMOs have to annually deliver measurement results on their quality of care to US authorities. One of these sets of measurements is defined in a specification called HEDIS which is infamous amongst data analysts for its complexity. Traditional solutions with either SAS-programs or SQL-queries lead to involved solutions whose maintenance and validation is difficult and binds considerable amount of resources.
In this paper we present the project in which we have applied Semantic Technologies to compute the most difficult part of the HEDIS measures. We show that we arrive at a clean, structured and legible encoding of HEDIS in the rule language of the RDF-triple store RDFox. We use RDFox's reasoning capabilities and SPARQL queries to compute and extract the results. The results of a whole Kaiser Permanente regional branch could be computed in competitive time by RDFox on readily available commodity hardware. Further development and deployment of the project results are envisaged in Kaiser Permanente."

In this study, the two technologies for the approach are introduced: a labeled multi graph named class graph to compute class-class relationships and an RDF specification named SPARQL Builder Metadata to obtain and store required metadata for construction of a class graph. In addition, as a practical application, we introduce the SPARQL Builder system, which assists users in writing semantic queries for LOD."

OBDA approach has a great potential to facilitate such tasks; however, it has a number of limitations in dealing with analytics that restrict its use in important industrial applications. Based on our experience with Siemens, we argue that in order to overcome those limitations OBDA should be extended and become analytics, source, and cost aware. In this work we propose such an extension. In particular, we propose an ontology, mapping, and query language for OBDA, where aggregate and other analytical functions are first class citizens. Moreover, we develop query optimisation techniques that allow to efficiently process analytical tasks over static and streaming data.

 engineering for Web-scale systems, is now a crucial technical and
 economic challenge. This requires new combined data and software
 engineering processes and tools. Semantic metadata standards and
 linked data principles, provide a technical grounding for such
 integrated systems given an appropriate model of the domain. In this
 paper we introduce the ALIGNED suite of ontologies specifically
 designed to model the information exchange needs of combined
 software and data engineering. The models have been deployed to
 enable: tool-chain integration, such as the exchange of data quality
 reports; cross-domain communication, such as interlinked data and
 software unit testing; mediation of the system design process
 through the capture of design intents and as a source of context for
 model-driven software engineering processes. These ontologies are
 deployed in web-scale, data-intensive, system development
 environments in both the commercial and academic domains. We
 exemplify the usage of the suite on a complex collaborative software
 and data engineering scenario from the legal information system

Systematically deployed on the Internet of Things (IoT), they would be able to form complete energy consuming, producing, and managing ecosystems. Smart systems are technically very heterogeneous, and standardized interfaces on a sensor and device level are therefore needed. However, standardization in IoT has largely focused at the technical communication level, leading to a large number of different solutions based on various standards and protocols, with limited attention to the common semantics contained in the message data structures exchanged at the technical level. The Smart Appliance REFerence ontology (SAREF) is a shared model of consensus developed in close interaction with the industry and with the support of the European Commission. It is published as a technical specification by ETSI and provides an important contribution to achieve semantic interoperability for smart appliances. This paper builds on the success achieved in standardizing SAREF and presents SAREF4EE, an extension of SAREF. SAREF4EE has been created in collaboration with the EEBus and Energy@Home industry associations to interconnect their (different) data models. By using SAREF4EE, smart appliances from different manufacturers that support the EEBus or Energy@Home standards can easily communicate with each other using any energy management system at home or in the cloud."

For this background, ontology construction and refinement costs a lot of time and ef-fort. In order to reduce such costs, we develop an ontology refinement support system. This system have two main function. First, the system can detect points that should be refined and propose how to refine it. Second, the system can evaluate ontologies quantitatively. This system indicate how ontologies are consistent in a classificatory criterion. To develop the refinement support system, we focus on a guideline for building well-organized ontologies that “Each subclass of a super class is distinguished by the values of exactly one attribute of the super class”. When an ontology is built following this guideline, there is similarity among Is-a hierarchies. We use these similar Is-a hierarchies and develop an ontology refinement system."

To achieve this, we use a Genetic Programming approach in a supervised learning method to generate path evaluation functions that compare well with human evaluations. We show how such a cost-function can be generated only using basic topological features of the nodes of the paths as they are being traversed (i.e. without knowledge of the whole graph), and how it can be improved through introducing a very small amount of knowledge about the vocabularies of the properties that connect nodes in the graph."

A particularly interesting approach is traversal-based query execution which fetches data by traversing data links and, thus, is able to make use of up-to-date data from initially unknown data sources. While the downside of this approach is the delay before the query engine completes a query execution, user perceived response time may be improved significantly by returning as many elements of the result set as soon as possible. To this end, the query engine requires a traversal strategy that enables the engine to fetch result-relevant data as early as possible. The challenge for such a strategy is that the query engine does not know a priori what data sources will be discovered during the query execution and which of them contain result-relevant data. In this paper, we investigate 14 different approaches to rank traversal steps and achieve a variety of traversal strategies. We experimentally study their impact on response times and compare them to a baseline that resembles a breadth-first traversal. While our experiments show that some of the approaches can achieve noteworthy improvements over the baseline in a significant number of cases, we also observe that for every approach, there is a non-negligible chance to achieve response times that are worse than the baseline."

It can thus happen that the same entity is both described by using schema.org annotations and by creating a text anchor pointing to its Wikipedia page. Often, those representations provide complementary information which is not exploited since those entities are disjoint.

In this project, we explore the extent to which entities represented in different ways repeat on the Web, how they are related, and how they complement (or link) to each other. Our initial experiments show that we can unveil a previously (unexploited) knowledge graph by applying simple instance matching techniques on a large collection of schema.org annotations and DBpedia. The resulting knowledge graph aggregates entities (often tail entities) scattered across several Web pages, and complements existing DBpedia entities with new facts and properties.

In order to facilitate further investigations in how to mine such information, we are releasing i) an excerpt of all CommonCrawl web pages containing both Wikipedia and schema.org annotations, ii) the toolset to extract this information and perform knowledge graph construction and mapping onto DBpedia, as well as iii) the resulting knowledge graph (VoldemortKG) obtained via label matching techniques."

The OWL coverage and conformance of these tools usually needs to be tested during development or for evaluation and comparison purposes. However, in particular for the testing of special OWL concepts and concept combinations, it can be tedious to find suitable ontologies and test cases. We have developed OntoBench, a generator for OWL 2 benchmark ontologies that can be used to test and compare ontology visualizers and related tools. In contrast to existing OWL benchmarks, OntoBench does not focus on scalability and performance but OWL coverage and concept combinations. Consistent benchmark ontologies are dynamically generated based on OWL 2 language constructs selected in a graphical user interface. OntoBench is available on GitHub and as a public service, making it easy to use the tool and generate custom ontologies or ontology fragments."

The key task in ontology localization is translating the lexical layer of an ontology, i.e., its labels, into some foreign language. For this task, we hypothesize that the translation quality can be improved by adapting a machine translation system to the domain of the ontology. To this end, we build on the success of existing statistical machine translation (SMT) approaches, and investigate the impact of different domain adaptation techniques on the task. In particular, we investigate three techniques: (i) enriching a phrase table by domain-specific translation candidates acquired from existing Web resources, (ii) relying on Explicit Semantic Analysis as an additional technique for scoring a certain translation of a given source phrase, as well as (iii) adaptation of the language model by means of weighting n-grams with scores obtained from topic modelling. We present in detail the impact of each of these three techniques on the task of translating ontology labels. We show that these techniques have a generally positive effect on the quality of translation of the ontology and that, in combination, they provide a significant improvement in quality. "

We report the use of SPARQL for two real data analytic use cases from the healthcare and life sciences domains, which exposed certain weaknesses in the current specification of SPARQL; specifically when the data being integrated is most conveniently accessed via RESTful services and in formats beyond RDF, such as XML. We therefore extended SPARQL with generalized 'service', constructs for accessing services beyond the SPARQL endpoints supported by 'service'; for efficiency, our constructs additionally needed to support posting data, which is also not supported by 'service'. Furthermore, data from multiple sources led to natural modularity in the queries, with different portions of the query pertaining to different sources, so we also extended SPARQL with a simple 'function' mechanism to isolate the mechanics of accessing each endpoint. We provide an open source implementation of this SPARQL endpoint in an RDF store called Quetzal, and evaluate its use in the two data analytic scenarios over real datasets."

The vocabulary of agricultural activity is then defined as the subset of the ontology. Since the ontology is consistent, extendable, and capable of some inferences thanks to Description Logics, so the vocabulary inherits these features. The vocabulary is also linked to existing vocabularies such as AGROVOC. It is expected to use in the data format in the agricultural IT system.

However, while this has become an established functionality in document search engines, the significance of time, especially when explicitly given, has not been recognized for entity recommendation, yet. We address this gap by introducing the task of time-aware entity recommendation.

ing to hardware characteristics of embedded devices. Since computing resources
on embedded devices are constraint, their usage should be context dependent.
Therefore, we work on a resource adaptation model that supports trading off
system performance and device resources depending on their availability. The
adaptation model is based on the resource cost model of the data management
techniques."

the number of types in a dataset is too big, the graph groups together all types that are subclass of a 
more general type, and users are given the option of navigating through this hierarchy of types, dividing type nodes 
into subtypes as they see fit. 
We illustrate our visualisation using the Linked Movie Database dataset, and offer as well the visualisation of DBpedia.

The main issue to create meaningful content-dependent advice for learners is that the system requires an understanding of the learning domain. The learners use the Semantic Open Learning Space (SOLS) to create a machine-understandable concept map that represent their knowledge. SOLS is able to dynamically generate questions depending on each learner’s concept map. The system uses history domain ontologies to generate questions that aim to help learners develop their deep historical considerations. An evaluation showed that the learners using the question generation function could express deeper historical considerations after learning.

Currently, it comprises a large compendium of interlinked and distributed datasets from multiple domains. Running complex queries on this compendium often requires accessing data from different endpoints within one query. The abundance of datasets and the need for running complex query has thus motivated a considerable body of work on SPARQL query federation systems, the dedicated means to access data distributed over the Web of Data. However, the granularity of previous evaluations of such systems has not allowed deriving of insights concerning their behavior in different steps involved during federated query processing. In this work, we perform extensive experiments to compare state-of-the-art SPARQL endpoint federation systems using the comprehensive performance evaluation framework FedBench. In addition to considering the tradition query runtime as an evaluation criterion, we extend the scope of our performance evaluation by considering criteria, which have not been paid much attention to in previous studies. In particular, we consider the number of sources selected, the total number of SPARQL ASK requests used, the completeness of answers as well as the source selection time. Yet, we show that they have a significant impact on the overall query runtime of existing systems. Moreover, we extend FedBench to mirror a highly distributed data environment and assess the behavior of existing systems by using the same performance criteria. As the result we provide a detailed analysis of the experimental outcomes that reveal novel insights for improving current and future SPARQL federation systems."

This provides users with means to browse ontology structures, enriched with statistics of the underlying data, facilitating exploratory activities and enabling visual query for highly precise information needs.

Previous approaches use machine learning to learn a model that extracts features related to the data of a domain, which requires the model to be re-trained for every new domain. Our solution uses similarity metrics as features to compare against labeled domain data and learns a matching function to infer the correct semantic labels for data. Since our approach depends on the learned similarity metrics but not the data itself, it is domain-independent and only needs to be trained once to work effectively across multiple domains. In our evaluation, our approach achieves higher accuracy than other approaches, even when the learned models are trained on domains other than the test domain."

In this paper we investigate how computers and in particular RDF stores can take advantage from this emergent schema to more compactly store RDF data and more efficiently optimize and execute SPARQL queries. To this end, we contribute techniques for efficient emergent schema aware RDF storage and new query operator algorithms for emergent schema aware scans and joins.

To avoid inefficient re-evaluations of already evaluated parts of a stream in respect to a query, incremental evaluation strategies are applied, i.e., the query results are obtained incrementally from the result set of the preceding processing state without having to re-evaluate all input buffers. This method is highly efficient but it comes at the cost of having to maintain processing state, which is not trivial, and may defeat performance advantages of the incremental evaluation strategy. In the context of RDF streams the problem is further aggravated by the hard-to-predict evolution of the structure of RDF graphs over time and the application of sub-optimal implementation approaches, e.g., using relational technologies for storing data and processing states which incur significant performance drawbacks for graph-based query patterns. To address these performance problems, this paper proposes a set of novel operator-aware data structures coupled with incremental evaluation algorithms which outperform the counterparts of relational stream processing systems. This claim is demonstrated through extensive experimental results on both simulated and real datasets."

The proposed approach employs lexicalization, aggregation, and referring expression generation to build a human-like enriched answer utilizing the triples extracted from the entities mentioned in the question as well as the entities contained in the answer."

Our solution achieves a fast query processing by replicating subsets of remote RDF datasets before query evaluation. To construct the replication process effectively, we present an update estimation model to handle the changes in updates over time. With the update estimation model, we re-compose instances of the replication process in response to some problems, i.e., the outdated data.
Finally, we conduct exhaustive tests with a real-world dataset to verify
our solution."

As the assets on the surface of the ground (e.g. pavements) and those buried under it (e.g. pipes and cables) are supported by the ground, the properties and processes of soil affect the performance of these assets to a significant degree. In order to make integrated decisions, it is necessary to combine the knowledge and expertise in multiple areas, such as roads, soil, buried assets, sensing, etc. This requires an underpinning knowledge model, in the form of an ontology. Within this context, we present a new ontology for describing soil properties (e.g. soil strength) and processes (e.g. soil compaction), as well as how they affect each other.

Since user activities can be represented in terms of re- lationships involving three or more things (e.g. a user tags movie items on a webpage), they can be represented as a tensor. The recent semantic sensitive tensor factorization (SSTF) is promising since it achieves high accuracies in predicting users’ activities by applying semantics behind objects (e.g. item categories) to tensor factorization. However, SSTF fo- cuses on the factorization of data logs from a single service and thus has two problems: (1) the balance problem caused when simultaneously han- dling heterogeneous datasets and (2) the sparcity problem caused when there are insufficient data logs within a single service. Our solution, Se- mantic Sensitive Simultaneous Tensor Factorization (S3TF), tackles the above problems by: (1) It creates tensors for individual services and fac- torizes those tensors simultaneously; it does not force to create a tensor from multiple services and factorize the single tensor. This avoids low prediction results caused by the balance problem. (2) It utilizes shared semantics behind distributed logs and gives semantic biases to each ten- sor factorization. This avoids the sparsity problem by using the shared se- mantics among services. Experiments using the real-world datasets show that S3TF achieves up to 13% higher accuracy in rating predictions than the current best tensor method. It also extracts implicit relationships across services in the feature spaces by simultaneouse factorization."

In an effort to develop a sembank (i.e., an annotated corpus dedicated to capturing the semantic meaning of a large set of annotated sentences), NLP researchers have developed the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) formulation. Each AMR is a rooted, labeled graph that represents the semantics of a single sentence. Nodes in the core AMR graph represent concepts/entities (such as nouns, PropBank frames, etc.) and edges represent relations between concepts, (such a frame-specific arguments, roles, etc.). AMRs have been used to annotate corpora of classic books, newstext and the biomedical research literature. Research is progressing on creating automatic parsers to generate AMRs directly from textual input. In the work described here, we map the AMR representation to a linked data format (AMR-LD), adopting the ontological formulation of the underlying AMR faithfully. We describe the process of generating AMR-LD data from standard AMRs derived from biomedical research articles, including mapping named entities to well-known linked-data resources, such as Uniprot and PubChem, as well as an open-source software to convert AMR data to RDF. We describe the benefits of AMR-LD, including convenient analysis using SPARQL queries and ontology inferences, and embedding into the web of Linked Data.

The project has delivered a set of guidelines for best practice which build on existing standards.

Another important output of this project was to specify the requirements for an Ontologies Mapping Tool. These requirements were used in a preliminary survey that established that such tools already exist which substantially meet them. Therefore, we have developed a formal process to define and submit a request for information (RFI) from existing ontologies mapping tool providers to enable their evaluation. This RFI process will be described and we summarise our findings from evaluation of seven ontologies mapping tools from academic and commercial providers. The guidelines and RFI materials are accessible on a public wiki:- https://pistoiaalliance.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PUB/Ontologies+Mapping+Resources.

This new track has been organised because currently, mappings between ontologies in a given data domain are mostly curated by bioinformatics and disease experts in academia or industry, who would benefit from automation of their procedures. This could be accomplished through implementation of ontology matching algorithms into their existing workflow environment or investment in an ontologies mapping tool for management of the ontologies mapping life cycle.
Work is in progress by the Ontologies Mapping project is to develop user requirements for an ontologies mapping service. We will conduct a survey of Pistoia Alliance members to understand the need for such a service and whether it should be implemented in future."

sameAs rules (7 rules), and schema rules (8 rules) since, as we investi-
gated, those triples corresponding to the rst three classes of rules are

In this paper, we provide rigorous theoretical underpinnings for faceted search in the context of RDF-based knowledge graphs enhanced with OWL 2 ontologies. We identify well-defined fragments of SPARQL that can be naturally captured using faceted search as a query paradigm, and establish the computational complexity of answering such queries. We also study the problem of updating faceted interfaces, which is critical for guiding users in the formulation of meaningful queries during exploratory search. We have implemented our approach in a fully-fledged faceted search system, SemFacet, which we have evaluated over the Yago knowledge graph."

So far, this task is often addressed by human curators in a three-step process: issuing appropriate keyword queries for the statement to check using standard search engines, retrieving potentially relevant documents and screening those documents for relevant content. The drawbacks of this process are manifold. Most importantly, it is very time-consuming as the experts have to carry out several search processes and must often read several documents. In this article, we present DeFacto (Deep Fact Validation)—an algorithm able to validate facts by finding trustworthy sources for them on the Web. DeFacto aims to provide an effective way of validating facts by supplying the user with relevant excerpts of web pages as well as useful additional information including a score for the confidence DeFacto has in the correctness of the input fact. To achieve this goal, DeFacto collects and combines evidence from web pages written in several languages. In addition, DeFacto provides support for facts with a temporal scope, i.e., it can estimate in which time frame a fact was valid. Given that the automatic evaluation of facts has not been paid much attention to so far, generic benchmarks for evaluating these frameworks were not previously available. We thus also present a generic evaluation framework for fact checking and make it publicly available."

This makes it interesting to create ontology based, user-oriented tools for searching and exploring this data. Although initial efforts were intended for tech users with knowledge of SPARQL/RDF, there are ongoing proposals designed for lay users. One of the most promising approaches is to use visual query interfaces, but more user studies are needed to assess their effectiveness. In this paper, we compare the effect on usability of two important paradigms for ontology-based query interfaces: form-based and graph-based interfaces. In order to reduce the number of variables affecting the comparison, we performed a user study with two state-of-the-art query tools developed by ourselves, sharing a large part of the code base: the graph-based tool OptiqueVQS*, and the form-based tool PepeSearch. We evaluated these tools in a formal comparison study with 15 participants searching a Linked Open Data version of the Norwegian Company Registry. Participants had to respond to 6 non-trivial search tasks using alternately OptiqueVQS* and PepeSearch. Even without previous training, retrieval performance and user confidence were very high, thus suggesting that both interface designs are effective for searching RDF datasets. Expert searchers had a clear preference for the graph-based interface, and mainstream searchers obtained better performance and confidence with the form-based interface. While a number of participants spontaneously praised the capability of the graph interface for composing complex queries, our results evidence that graph interfaces are difficult to grasp. In contrast, form interfaces are more learnable and relieve problems with disorientation for mainstream users. We have also observed positive results introducing faceted search and dynamic term suggestion in semantic search interfaces."

However, Horn rules do not take into account possible exceptions, so that predicting facts via such rules introduces errors. 
To overcome this problem, we present a method for effective revision of learned Horn rules by effectively incorporating exceptions (i.e., negated atoms) into their bodies. This way errors are largely reduced. We apply our method to discover rules with exceptions from real-world KGs. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method and the improvements in accuracy for KG completion by rule-based fact prediction."

In this paper we propose a semantic-based approach for radicalisation detection on Twitter.

Our results show that classifiers trained from words' semantics outperform those trained from lexical and network features by 2% on average F1-measure.

Mining reachability relationships between entities is an important task for extracting knowledge from LOD. Diverse labeling schemes have been proposed to efficiently determine the reachability. We focus on a state-of-the-art 2-hop labeling scheme that is based on a permutation of vertices to achieve a linear index size and reduce on-line searches that are required when the reachability cannot be answered by 2-hop labels only. We observed that the approach can be improved in three different ways; 1) space-efficiency - guarantee the minimized index size without randomness 2) update-efficiency - update labels efficiently when graphs changes 3) parallelization - labeling should be cluster-based, and solved in a distributed fashion. In these regards, this PhD thesis proposes optimization techniques that address these issues. In this paper in particular, a way of reducing the 2-hop label size is proposed with preliminary results on real-world DAG datasets.

data into RDF. However, as we will illustrate, Open Data tables typically contain
a large portion of numerical columns and/or non-textual headers; therefore
solutions that solely focus on textual “cues” are only partially applicable for mapping
such data sources. We propose an approach to find and rank candidates of
semantic labels and context descriptions for a given bag of numerical values. To
this end, we apply a hierarchical clustering over information taken from DBpedia
to build a background knowledge graph of possible “semantic contexts” for
bags of numerical values, over which we perform a nearest neighbour search to
rank the most likely candidates. Our evaluation shows that our approach can assign
fine-grained semantic labels, when there is enough supporting evidence in

assign high level contexts to the data, which could potentially be used in combination
with other approaches to narrow down the search space of possible labels."

SPORTAL sends queries to individual endpoints offline to learn about their content, generating a best-effort VoID description for each endpoint.

A large and useful set of ontology languages enjoys FOL reducibility of query answering: queries can be answered by evaluating a SQLized first-order logic (FOL) formula (obtained from the query and the ontology) directly against the explicitly stored data (i.e., without considering the ontological constraints).

With the switch from analog to digital technology the entire process of production, distribution, and archival of a film and tv program large amounts of data are created. Besides recorded and processed audiovisual information, in each single step of the production process and furthermore throughout the entire media value chain new metadata is created, administrated, and put into relation with already existing metadata mandatory for the management of these processes. Due to competing standards as well as to proprietary and incompatible interfaces of the applied software tools, a significant amount of this metadata is lost again and not available for subsequent steps in the process chain. As a consequence most of this valuable information has to be costly recreated in each single step of media production, distribution, and archival. Currently, there is no generally accepted nor commonly used metadata exchange format that is applied throughout the media value chain. But, also the market for media production companies has changed dramatically towards the internet as being the preferred distribution channel for all media content. Today’s available limited budget for media production companies puts additional pressure to work in a cost and time efficient way and not to waste resources due to the necessity of costly reengineering of lost metadata. The dwerft project aims to apply Linked Data principles for all metadata exchange through all steps of the media value chain. Starting with the very first idea for a script, all metadata are mapped to either existing or newly developed ontologies to be reused in subsequent steps of the media value chain. Thus, metadata collected during the media production becomes a valuable asset not only for each step from pre- to postproduction, but also in distribution and archival.
This paper presents results of the dwerft project about the successful integration of a set of film production tools based on the Linked Production Data Cloud, a technology platform for the film and tv industry to enable software interoperability used in production, distribution, and archival of audiovisual content."

which proposes an uniform view on all interfaces to rdf. This reveals a complete
spectrum between Linked Data documents and the sparql protocol, in which
we can advance the state-of-the-art of Linked Data publishing. This axis can be
explored in the following two dimensions: i) Selector, allowing different, more
complex questions for the server; and ii) Metadata, extending the response
with more information clients can use.
This work studies the second Metadata dimension in a practical Web context.
Considering the conditions on the Web, this problem becomes three-fold. First,
analog to the Web itself, ldf interfaces should exist in a distributed, scalable
manner in order to succeed. Generating additional metadata introduces overhead
on the server, which influences the ability to scale towards multiple clients. Second,
the communication between client and server uses the http protocol. Modeling,
serialization, and compression determine the extra load the overall network traffic.
Third, with query execution on the client, novel approaches need to apply this
metadata intelligently to increase efficiency.
Concretely, this work defines and evaluates a series of transparent, interchangeable,
and discoverable interface features. We proposed Triple Pattern Fragments, a Linked Data api with low-server cost, as a fundamental base . This
interface uses a single triple pattern as selector. To explore this research space,
we append this interface with different metadata, starting with an estimated
number of total matching triples. By combining several tpfs, sparql queries are
evaluated on the client-side, using the metadata for optimization. Hence, we can
measure the query execution"

This makes them rapidly out of date, and limited in application, particularly for patients with co-morbidities (multiple co-occurring conditions). Semantic Web and Quantified Self technologies make it possible to address this task in a much more principled way, to maximise knowledge and data reuse and minimise maintenance requirements while enabling new and sophisticated applications involving widely-available biometric sensors. 

We present a framework for calculating clinical risk predictions for patients based on automatically-gathered biometric data. This framework relies on generic, reusable ontologies for representing clinical risk, and sensor readings, and reasoning to support the integration of data represented according to these ontologies. This integration makes novel use of Semantic Web technologies, and supports straightforward extension and maintenance by medical professionals. The framework is evaluated in terms of its predictions, extensibility and ease of use for domain experts."

The latter has traditionally been termed 'Social Meaning', a
concept that has been discussed but not yet quantitatively
studied by the Semantic Web community.

In this paper we use statistical model learning as a method to
quantify the meaning that is (at least) encoded in Semantic Web
names, We implement the approach and evaluate it over hundreds of
thousands of data sets in order to illustrate its efficacy. Our
experiments confirm that many Semantic Web names are indeed
meaningful and, more interestingly, we provide a quantitative
lower bound on how much meaning is (at least) encoded in names on
a per-dataset basis.

To our knowledge, this is the first paper about the interaction
between social and formal meaning, as well as the first paper
that uses statistical model learning as a method to quantify

that popular ontology languages, such as OWL and Datalog, cannot 
express even the most basic relationships on the normalised data

reasoning undecidable, and normalising them to suit KGs can destroy 
syntactic restrictions that ensure decidability and low complexity. We

In these applications, one query pattern is especially prominent: a join between a continuous data stream and some background data (BGD). Oftentimes, the target BGD is large, maintained externally, changing slowly, and costly to query (both in terms of time and money). Hence, practical applications usually maintain a local (cached) view of the relevant BGD. Given that these caches are not updated as part of the transaction modifying the original BGD, they should be maintained under realistic budget constraints (in terms of latency, computation time, and possibly financial cost) to avoid stale data leading to wrong answers. 

This paper proposes to model the join between streams and the BGD as a bipartite graph. By exploiting the graph structure, we keep the quality of results good enough without refreshing the entire cache for each evaluation. We also introduce two extensions to this method: first, we consider both the sliding window (specifying the currently relevant section of the data stream) and the change rate of the BGD to focus on updates that have the longest effect. Second, by considering the future impact of a query to the BGD we propose to sometimes delay updates to provide more fresher answers in future.

Using an implemented system we empirically show that we can improve result freshness by 93% over baseline algorithms such as Random Selection or Least Recently Updated."
