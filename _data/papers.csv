In this paper, we present a collection of 22 benchmark datasets at different sizes, derived from existing Semantic Web datasets as well as from external classification and regression problems linked to datasets in the Linked Open Data cloud. Such a collection of datasets can be used to conduct qualitative performance testing and systematic comparisons of approaches."

But while it has been easy to assess the systems' computational efficiency, it has been much harder to assess how well different semantic systems help their users find and browse information. In this article, we propose and demonstrate the use of a benchmark for evaluating them, similar to the TREC benchmark for evaluating traditional search engines. Our benchmark includes a set of typical user tasks and a well-defined procedure for assigning a measure of performance on those tasks to a semantic system. We demonstrate its application to one such system, Rhizomer. We intend for this work to initiate a community conversation that will lead to a general accepted framework for comparing systems and measuring, and thus encouraging, progress towards better semantic search and exploration tools."

This makes it interesting to create ontology based, user-oriented tools for searching and exploring this data. Although initial efforts were intended for tech users with knowledge of SPARQL/RDF, there are ongoing proposals designed for lay users. One of the most promising approaches is to use visual query interfaces, but more user studies are needed to assess their effectiveness. In this paper, we compare the effect on usability of two important paradigms for ontology-based query interfaces: form-based and graph-based interfaces. In order to reduce the number of variables affecting the comparison, we performed a user study with two state-of-the-art query tools developed by ourselves, sharing a large part of the code base: the graph-based tool OptiqueVQS*, and the form-based tool PepeSearch. We evaluated these tools in a formal comparison study with 15 participants searching a Linked Open Data version of the Norwegian Company Registry. Participants had to respond to 6 non-trivial search tasks using alternately OptiqueVQS* and PepeSearch. Even without previous training, retrieval performance and user confidence were very high, thus suggesting that both interface designs are effective for searching RDF datasets. Expert searchers had a clear preference for the graph-based interface, and mainstream searchers obtained better performance and confidence with the form-based interface. While a number of participants spontaneously praised the capability of the graph interface for composing complex queries, our results evidence that graph interfaces are difficult to grasp. In contrast, form interfaces are more learnable and relieve problems with disorientation for mainstream users. We have also observed positive results introducing faceted search and dynamic term suggestion in semantic search interfaces."

Ontology structures provide an unambiguous description of the structure and content of data. While a multitude of software applications and visualization systems have been developed over the past years for Linked Data, there is still a significant gap that exists between applications that consume Linked Data and interfaces that have been designed with significant focus on aesthetics. Though the importance of aesthetics in affecting the usability, effectiveness and acceptability of user interfaces have long been recognised, little or no explicit attention has been paid to the aesthetics of Linked Data applications. In this paper, we introduce a formalised approach to developing aesthetically pleasing semantic web interfaces by following aesthetic principles and guidelines identified from literature. We apply such principles to design and develop a generic approach of using visualizations to support exploration of Linked Data, in an interface that is pleasing to users. This provides users with means to browse ontology structures, enriched with statistics of the underlying data, facilitating exploratory activities and enabling visual query for highly precise information needs. We evaluated our approach in three ways: an initial objective evaluation comparing our approach with other well-known interfaces for the semantic web and two user evaluations with semantic web researchers."

It can thus happen that the same entity is both described by using schema.org annotations and by creating a text anchor pointing to its Wikipedia page. Often, those representations provide complementary information which is not exploited since those entities are disjoint.

In this project, we explore the extent to which entities represented in different ways repeat on the Web, how they are related, and how they complement (or link) to each other. Our initial experiments show that we can unveil a previously (unexploited) knowledge graph by applying simple instance matching techniques on a large collection of schema.org annotations and DBpedia. The resulting knowledge graph aggregates entities (often tail entities) scattered across several Web pages, and complements existing DBpedia entities with new facts and properties.

In order to facilitate further investigations in how to mine such information, we are releasing i) an excerpt of all CommonCrawl web pages containing both Wikipedia and schema.org annotations, ii) the toolset to extract this information and perform knowledge graph construction and mapping onto DBpedia, as well as iii) the resulting knowledge graph (VoldemortKG) obtained via label matching techniques."

So far, this task is often addressed by human curators in a three-step process: issuing appropriate keyword queries for the statement to check using standard search engines, retrieving potentially relevant documents and screening those documents for relevant content. The drawbacks of this process are manifold. Most importantly, it is very time-consuming as the experts have to carry out several search processes and must often read several documents. In this article, we present DeFacto (Deep Fact Validation)—an algorithm able to validate facts by finding trustworthy sources for them on the Web. DeFacto aims to provide an effective way of validating facts by supplying the user with relevant excerpts of web pages as well as useful additional information including a score for the confidence DeFacto has in the correctness of the input fact. To achieve this goal, DeFacto collects and combines evidence from web pages written in several languages. In addition, DeFacto provides support for facts with a temporal scope, i.e., it can estimate in which time frame a fact was valid. Given that the automatic evaluation of facts has not been paid much attention to so far, generic benchmarks for evaluating these frameworks were not previously available. We thus also present a generic evaluation framework for fact checking and make it publicly available."

The key task in ontology localization is translating the lexical layer of an ontology, i.e., its labels, into some foreign language. For this task, we hypothesize that the translation quality can be improved by adapting a machine translation system to the domain of the ontology. To this end, we build on the success of existing statistical machine translation (SMT) approaches, and investigate the impact of different domain adaptation techniques on the task. In particular, we investigate three techniques: (i) enriching a phrase table by domain-specific translation candidates acquired from existing Web resources, (ii) relying on Explicit Semantic Analysis as an additional technique for scoring a certain translation of a given source phrase, as well as (iii) adaptation of the language model by means of weighting n-grams with scores obtained from topic modelling. We present in detail the impact of each of these three techniques on the task of translating ontology labels. We show that these techniques have a generally positive effect on the quality of translation of the ontology and that, in combination, they provide a significant improvement in quality. "

In an effort to develop a sembank (i.e., an annotated corpus dedicated to capturing the semantic meaning of a large set of annotated sentences), NLP researchers have developed the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) formulation. Each AMR is a rooted, labeled graph that represents the semantics of a single sentence. Nodes in the core AMR graph represent concepts/entities (such as nouns, PropBank frames, etc.) and edges represent relations between concepts, (such a frame-specific arguments, roles, etc.). AMRs have been used to annotate corpora of classic books, newstext and the biomedical research literature. Research is progressing on creating automatic parsers to generate AMRs directly from textual input. In the work described here, we map the AMR representation to a linked data format (AMR-LD), adopting the ontological formulation of the underlying AMR faithfully. We describe the process of generating AMR-LD data from standard AMRs derived from biomedical research articles, including mapping named entities to well-known linked-data resources, such as Uniprot and PubChem, as well as an open-source software to convert AMR data to RDF. We describe the benefits of AMR-LD, including convenient analysis using SPARQL queries and ontology inferences, and embedding into the web of Linked Data. Finally, we discuss the possible impact of semantic web representations that are directly derived from natural language."

In this paper, we present a method and tools to automatically build knowledge graphs from news articles. As news articles describe changes in the world through the events they report, we present an approach to create Event-Centric Knowledge Graphs (ECKGs) using state-of-the-art natural language processing and semantic web techniques. Such ECKGs capture long-term developments and histories on hundreds of thousands of entities and are complementary to the static encyclopedic information in traditional knowledge graphs. We describe our event-centric representation schema, the challenges in extracting event information from news, our open source pipeline, and the knowledge graphs we have extracted from four different news corpora: general news (Wikinews), the FIFA world cup, the Global Automotive Industry, and Airbus A380 airplanes. Furthermore, we present an assessment on the accuracy of the pipeline in extracting the triples of the knowledge graphs. Moreover, through an event-centered browser and visualization tool we show how approaching information from news in an event-centric manner can increase the user’s understanding of the domain, facilitates the reconstruction of news story lines, and enable to perform exploratory investigation of news hidden facts."""

The LOV initiative gathers and makes visible indicators that have not been previously harvested such as the interconnections between vocabularies, version history along with past and current referent (individual or organization). The report details the various components of the system along with some innovations such as the introduction of a property-level boost in the vocabulary search scoring which takes into account the property's type (e.g rdfs:label, dc:comment) associated with a matching literal value. By providing an extensive range of data access methods (full-text search, SPARQL endpoint, API, data dump or UI), the project aims at facilitating the reuse of well-documented vocabularies in the Linked Data ecosystem.

In this paper we introduce the ALIGNED suite of ontologies or vocabularies specifically designed to model the information exchange needs of combined software and data engineering processes. The models have been deployed to enable: tool-chain integration, such as the exchange of data quality reports; cross-domain communication, such as interlinked data and software unit testing; mediation of the system design process through the capture of design intents and as a source of context for model-driven software engineering processes. These ontologies are deployed in trial live web-scale, data-intensive system development environments in both the commercial and academic domains. We exemplify the usage of the suite on a complex collaborative software and data engineering scenario from the legal information system domain."

As the assets on the surface of the ground (e.g. pavements) and those buried under it (e.g. pipes and cables) are supported by the ground, the properties and processes of soil affect the performance of these assets to a significant degree. In order to make integrated decisions, it is necessary to combine the knowledge and expertise in multiple areas, such as roads, soil, buried assets, sensing, etc. This requires an underpinning knowledge model, in the form of an ontology. Within this context, we present a new ontology for describing soil properties (e.g. soil strength) and processes (e.g. soil compaction), as well as how they affect each other. This ontology can be used to express how the ground affects and is affected by assets buried under the ground or on the ground surface.

The Audio Feature Ontology is based on the analysis of existing tools and music informatics literature, which was instrumental in guiding the ontology engineering process. The ontology provides a descriptive framework for expressing different conceptualisations of the audio feature extraction domain and enables designing linked data formats for representing feature data. In this paper, we discuss important modelling decisions and introduce a harmonised ontology library consisting of modular interlinked ontologies that describe the different entities and activities involved in music creation, production and publishing."

We discuss important conceptualisations of different abstraction layers, their necessity to successfully model audio effects, and their application method. We present use cases concerning the application of effects in music production projects, and the creation of audio effect metadata facilitating a linked data service exposing information about effect implementations. By doing so, we show how our model benefits knowledge sharing, and enables reproducibility and analysis of audio production workflows."

The increasing amounts of RDF data available raise a major need and research interest in building efficient and scalable distributed SPARQL query evaluators. In this context, we propose and share SPARQLGX: our implementation of a distributed RDF datastore based on Apache Spark. SPARQLGX is designed to leverage existing Hadoop infrastructures for evaluating SPARQL queries. SPARQLGX relies on a translation of SPARQL queries into executable Spark code that adopts evaluation strategies according to (1) the storage method used and (2) statistics on data. We show that SPARQLGX makes it possible to evaluate SPARQL queries on billions of triples distributed across multiple nodes, while providing attractive performance figures. We report on experiments which show how SPARQLGX compares to related state-of-the-art implementations. Using a simple design, SPARQLGX already represents an interesting alternative in several scenarios. We share it as a resource for the further construction of efficient SPARQL evaluators."

We select two popular SPARQL databases (Virtuoso, Blazegraph), a popular relational database (PostgreSQL), and a popular graph database (Neo4J) for comparison and discuss various options as to how Wikidata can be represented in the models of each engine. We design a set of experiments to test the relative query performance of these representations in the context of their respective engines. We first execute a large set of atomic lookups to establish a baseline performance for each test setting, and subsequently perform experiments on instances of more complex graph patterns based on real-world examples. We conclude with a summary of the strengths and limitations of the engines observed."

Currently, it comprises a large compendium of interlinked and distributed datasets from multiple domains. Running complex queries on this compendium often requires accessing data from different endpoints within one query. The abundance of datasets and the need for running complex query has thus motivated a considerable body of work on SPARQL query federation systems, the dedicated means to access data distributed over the Web of Data. However, the granularity of previous evaluations of such systems has not allowed deriving of insights concerning their behavior in different steps involved during federated query processing. In this work, we perform extensive experiments to compare state-of-the-art SPARQL endpoint federation systems using the comprehensive performance evaluation framework FedBench. In addition to considering the tradition query runtime as an evaluation criterion, we extend the scope of our performance evaluation by considering criteria, which have not been paid much attention to in previous studies. In particular, we consider the number of sources selected, the total number of SPARQL ASK requests used, the completeness of answers as well as the source selection time. Yet, we show that they have a significant impact on the overall query runtime of existing systems. Moreover, we extend FedBench to mirror a highly distributed data environment and assess the behavior of existing systems by using the same performance criteria. As the result we provide a detailed analysis of the experimental outcomes that reveal novel insights for improving current and future SPARQL federation systems."

The OWL coverage and conformance of these tools usually needs to be tested during development or for evaluation and comparison purposes. However, in particular for the testing of special OWL concepts and concept combinations, it can be tedious to find suitable ontologies and test cases. We have developed OntoBench, a generator for OWL 2 benchmark ontologies that can be used to test and compare ontology visualizers and related tools. In contrast to existing OWL benchmarks, OntoBench does not focus on scalability and performance but OWL coverage and concept combinations. Consistent benchmark ontologies are dynamically generated based on OWL 2 language constructs selected in a graphical user interface. OntoBench is available on GitHub and as a public service, making it easy to use the tool and generate custom ontologies or ontology fragments."

Many existing knowledge graphs are either available as Linked Open Data, or they can be exported as RDF datasets enhanced with background knowledge in the form of an OWL 2 ontology. Faceted search is the de facto approach for exploratory search in many online applications, and has been recently proposed as a suitable paradigm for querying RDF repositories. In this paper, we provide rigorous theoretical underpinnings for faceted search in the context of RDF-based knowledge graphs enhanced with OWL 2 ontologies. We identify well-defined fragments of SPARQL that can be naturally captured using faceted search as a query paradigm, and establish the computational complexity of answering such queries. We also study the problem of updating faceted interfaces, which is critical for guiding users in the formulation of meaningful queries during exploratory search. We have implemented our approach in a fully-fledged faceted search system, SemFacet, which we have evaluated over the Yago knowledge graph."

We implemented a tool named Aemoo that supports EKP-driven knowledge exploration and integrates data coming from heterogeneous resources, namely static and dynamic knowledge as well as text and Linked Data. Aemoo is evaluated by means of controlled, task-driven user experiments in order to assess its usability, and ability to provide relevant and serendipitous information as compared to two existing tools: Google and RelFinder."

Systematically deployed on the Internet of Things (IoT), they would be able to form complete energy consuming, producing, and managing ecosystems. Smart systems are technically very heterogeneous, and standardized interfaces on a sensor and device level are therefore needed. However, standardization in IoT has largely focused at the technical communication level, leading to a large number of different solutions based on various standards and protocols, with limited attention to the common semantics contained in the message data structures exchanged at the technical level. The Smart Appliance REFerence ontology (SAREF) is a shared model of consensus developed in close interaction with the industry and with the support of the European Commission. It is published as a technical specification by ETSI and provides an important contribution to achieve semantic interoperability for smart appliances. This paper builds on the success achieved in standardizing SAREF and presents SAREF4EE, an extension of SAREF. SAREF4EE has been created in collaboration with the EEBus and Energy@Home industry associations to interconnect their (different) data models. By using SAREF4EE, smart appliances from different manufacturers that support the EEBus or Energy@Home standards can easily communicate with each other using any energy management system at home or in the cloud."

To avoid inefficient re-evaluations of already evaluated parts of a stream in respect to a query, incremental evaluation strategies are applied, i.e., the query results are obtained incrementally from the result set of the preceding processing state without having to re-evaluate all input buffers. This method is highly efficient but it comes at the cost of having to maintain processing state, which is not trivial, and may defeat performance advantages of the incremental evaluation strategy. In the context of RDF streams the problem is further aggravated by the hard-to-predict evolution of the structure of RDF graphs over time and the application of sub-optimal implementation approaches, e.g., using relational technologies for storing data and processing states which incur significant performance drawbacks for graph-based query patterns. To address these performance problems, this paper proposes a set of novel operator-aware data structures coupled with incremental evaluation algorithms which outperform the counterparts of relational stream processing systems. This claim is demonstrated through extensive experimental results on both simulated and real datasets."

In this context, RDF Stream Processing (RSP) and Stream Reasoning (SR) have emerged as solutions to combine semantic technologies with stream and event processing techniques. 
Research in these areas has proposed an ecosystem of solutions to query, reason and perform real time processing over heterogeneous and distributed data streams on the Web.
However, so far one basic building block has been missing: a mechanism to disseminate and exchange RDF streams on the Web.
In this work we close this gap, proposing TripleWave, a reusable and generic tool that enables the publication of RDF streams on the Web. 
The features of TripleWave have been derived from requirements of real use-cases, and consider a diverse set of scenarios, independent of any specific RSP implementation.
TripleWave can be fed with existing Web streams (e.g. Twitter and Wikipedia streams) or time-annotated RDF datasets (e.g. the LinkedSensorData set), and it can be invoked through both pull- and push-based mechanisms, thus also enabling RSP engines to automatically register and receive data from TripleWave."
