<h3>About</h3>
<p class="text-justify">

Kobe International Conference Center is Japan's closest international convention center from airports. Kobe is easy to reach from any country. Located on an island, Kobe's primary convention facilities are all just minutes from one another, including conference and exhibition halls, hotels and restaurants. Trains from an adjacent station run every 5 minutes to downtown Kobe and connect to Japan's very best tourism attractions.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
Kobe International Conference Center provides good enough facilities to hold international conferences. We will use the most of the facilities in it and also those in two nearby hotels for lunch and dinner and additional workshop rooms if necessary. There are the main hall with ca. 700 seats and plenty of small and medium rooms. We will use the main hall and three medium rooms (ca. 100 seats) for the main conference, and eleven small and medium rooms (ca. 50-100 seats) for workshops and tutorials. We will also use the foyer in front of the main hall for coffee break, demo and posters. The dinner will be provided at the hall in the hotel directly connected to the conference center. The lunch will be provided at the room in the hotel too.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
Japan is one of the most advanced countries for Internet connection in speed and area. Internet connection is provided for the conference center already but we will strengthen WAN connection and wifi facilities for the conference.

<h3>Access</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
The access to the venue is easy and convenient. Kobe Airport, the nearest regional airport, is really close to the venue, i.e., just in 8 minutes by the automated guided transit or taxi. It connects Tokyo Haneda Airport which provides flights from/to various international cities (Europe: London, Paris, Frankfurt, Munich, North America: New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angles, Vancouver, Toronto, Asia: many cities). 
The nearest international airport is Kansai International Airport which is about 40 minutes from/to the venue by ship and the automated guided transit. It offers direct flights from/to the various cities (Europe: Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Rome, Helsinki, North America: New York, San Francisco, Asia: many cities).
Narita International Airport, the largest international airport in Japan, which connects more than 100 cities abroad. Kobe is 3 hours form Tokyo by Shinkansen Train or 1 hour by flight.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
Generally speaking, the flight between Japan and Europe takes 10-12 hours and the flight between Japan and North America is 9 hours (West Coast) or 12-14 hours (East Coast).
