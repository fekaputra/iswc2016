    <h2 class="panel-title">GPS trajectory linked data project</h2>
  </div>

    <p><strong>The volunteer application form is closed. Thanks for your submissions!</strong></p>
    <p>Recently we are investigating the possibility for new research field of semantic technology for dynamically updating information from sensor measurement on IoT devices.</p>
    <p>In the ISWC 2016, we will try to have an experiment as a demonstration of the possibility.  Since it is expected to make a collaborative activity with the host city of ISWC, Kobe, we decided to gather user’s trajectories during ISWC as an analytic demonstration for tourist around Kobe. Volunteers are provided a small GPS device. We will try to investigate Points of Interest (PoI) and the relational map among PoI in RDF. We will provide the RDF data to show the possibility and never provide any specific information about individual trajectories, which are just only used as a source of statistical analysis.</p>
    <p>We call for the volunteers who allow us to gather your trajectories during ISWC.</p>
    <p>We never collect and use any specific personal information for the experiment.</p>
    <p>Experimental Condition:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Volunteers are required to receive and bring the GPS device during the stay in during the conference.</li>
      <li>Volunteer's movements are recorded on the GPS device.</li>
      <li>The statistical information, such as PoI, relational map, will be provided for further research and analysis.</li>
      <li>We never provide individual’s trajectory to others.</li>
      <li>We never collect any personal information for the analysis.</li>
      <li>Volunteers can keep a right to claim to remove their information in future.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The number of volunteers is limited due to the limitation of the number of GPS devices. Participants are selected on the first-come basis if there will be more applications than the number of GPS devices.</p>
    <p>We wish the experiment may contribute to making outcome on semantic technology.</p>
    <p>Organizer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Teruaki Yokoyama, Kobe Institute of Computing</li>
      <li>Kouji Kozaki, Osaka University</li>
      <li>Yoshiaki Fukami, Rikkyo University</li>
