    	In this track of ISWC 2016, we are looking for novel and significant research contributions addressing theoretical, analytical, empirical, and practical aspects of this broad field. While we welcome work that relates to the W3C Semantic Web recommendations (e.g., RDF, OWL, SPARQL, etc.), we encourage submissions that investigate other approaches to the intersection of semantics and the Web.

    	The ISWC 2016 Resources Track aims to encourage resource sharing following best practice within the Semantic Web community by calling for submissions of resources and their accompanying papers. This track calls for contributions that provide a concise and clear description of a resource  and its (expected) usage. Typical resource types are: ontologies, vocabularies, datasets, benchmarks and replication studies, services and software. Besides these established types of resources, we also welcome the submission of new types of resources such as ontology design patterns, crowdsourcing task designs, workflows, methodologies, protocols and measures, and so forth.

    	The Applications (Emerging, In-Use, Industry) Track at ISWC 2016 provides a forum for the community to explore the benefits and challenges of applying semantic technologies in concrete, practical applications, in contexts ranging from industry to government and science. We are especially interested this year in applications that use the emerging knowledge graphs or semantic technologies on the web together with data mining, reasoning, machine learning, or natural language processing techniques to the benefit of concrete, real-world scenarios.

    	In addition to the regular research and workshop program, ISWC 2016 will feature a tutorial program addressing the diverse interests of its audience: Semantic Web practitioners that wish to learn about new technologies, novices to the Semantic Web interested in introductory tutorials to key Semantic Web / Linked Data topics, government and industry representatives focusing on the applicability of Semantic Web / Linked Data technologies in practical settings.

    <p class="text-justify">
    	Besides the main technical programme, ISWC will host a number of workshops on topics related to the general theme of the conference. The role of the workshops is to provide a context for a focused and intensive scientific exchange among researchers interested in a particular topic. As such, workshops are the primary venues for the exploration of emerging ideas as well as for the discussion of novel aspects of established research topics.

  <div class="panel-body">
    <p class="text-justify">
    	The ISWC 2016 Posters and Demonstrations complement the paper tracks of the conference and offer an opportunity for presenting late-breaking research results, on-going research projects, and speculative or innovative work in progress. The informal setting of the Posters and Demonstrations encourages presenters and participants to engage in discussions about the work. Such discussions can be invaluable inputs for the future work of the presenters, while offering participants an effective way to broaden their knowledge of the emerging research trends and to network with other researchers.

    	The ISWC 2016 Doctoral Consortium will take place as part of the 15th International Semantic Web Conference in Kobe, Japan. This forum will provide PhD students an opportunity to share and develop their research ideas in a critical but supportive environment, to get feedback from mentors who are senior members of the Semantic Web research community, to explore issues related to academic and research careers, and to build relationships with other Semantic Web PhD students from around the world.
