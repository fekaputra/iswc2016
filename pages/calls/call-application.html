	Semantic technologies are reaching maturity on the web, especially through the increase in their use to publish, structure and make sense of web data, whether they are in the form of linked data, through schema.org, or with semantics included in other data formats than RDF (CSV, JSON, etc). The Applications (Emerging, In-Use, Industry) Track at ISWC 2016 provides a forum for the community to explore the benefits and challenges of applying semantic technologies in concrete, practical applications, in contexts ranging from industry to government and science. We are especially interested this year in applications that use the emerging knowledge graphs or semantic technologies on the web together with data mining, reasoning, machine learning, or natural language processing techniques to the benefit of concrete, real-world scenarios. We are also looking for descriptions of applied and validated industry solutions as software tools, systems or architecture that benefit from the adoption of semantic technologies. In this respect this track will accept three different types of submissions:

	<div class="panel panel-default">
	  	<div class="panel-heading">In-Use Applications</div>
	  	<div class="panel-body text-justify">
	    	Papers presenting applications of semantic technologies (In Use) <strong>should provide evidence that there is actual, significant use of the proposed application</strong> or tool by the target user group, preferably outside the group that conducted the development. A main focus of the submission should be on the way semantics and semantic technologies are impacting this development, through benefiting the intended use cases, as well as, if relevant, through the added challenges they introduce.
	 	 </div>
	</div>

	<div class="panel panel-default">
	  	<div class="panel-heading">Industry Applications</div>
	  	<div class="panel-body text-justify">
	    	Papers presenting industry solutions <strong>should clearly describe a business case / motivation and demonstrate their impact in the respective industry while ideally positioning the value of the tool or system</strong> for the semantic web community.
	 	 </div>
	</div>

	<div class="panel panel-default">
	  	<div class="panel-heading">Emerging Applications</div>
	  	<div class="panel-body text-justify">
	    	Papers presenting emerging applications, as early reports on real-world projects, <strong>should expose substantial contributions in terms of semantics requirements, testing of approaches or infrastructure, evaluations of early prototypes</strong>. Such papers will present mature technology contributions not yet deployed at large scale. We expect early versions of in-use or industry solutions with details on requirements or early phases of large scale deployment in real world settings.

	</div>
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
	We strongly encourage authors to clearly expose (1) limitations of existing (if any) “non-semantics” approaches that address similar challenges, (2) benefits of semantic technologies (e.g., measurable impacts such as accuracy, scalability, usability or functionality) in real-world settings, and (3) lessons learned from experimentation and / or large scale deployment.
	We therefore expect submissions to the Applications (Emerging, In-Use, Industry) Track to contain at least the following elements:

	We therefore expect submissions to the Applications (Emerging, In-Use, Industry) Track to contain at least the following elements:
	<ul class="text-justify">
		<li>
			A clear description and motivation of the problem being addressed, and of its importance in the corresponding domain
		</li>

		<li>
			A description of the system, application or tool developed that clearly shows the role that semantic technologies and principles are playing in its architecture, or the contribution helping the adoption of semantic technologies and principles
		</li>

		<li>
			A clear statement about the current user / client base of the system, application or tool (including size and composition, e.g. domain experts, developers, etc.), as well as plans for deployment/adoption
		</li>

		<li>
			For In-Use papers: A discussion on the benefits and challenges associated with the use of semantic technologies and principles in the considered scenarios, both from a technical (what the technology enables) and a non-technical (e.g. development effort required, effect on user interaction/satisfaction, policy-related issues) point of view 
		</li>

		<li>
			For Industry papers: A clear description of the impact in the respective industry and motivation for the need of semantic web technologies.
		</li>

		<li>
			For Emerging applications: A clear description on requirements or next steps for large scale deployment in real world settings. The Semantic Web community should benefit from lessons learned / advices for emerging applications to be deployed in large scale environments.
		</li>
	</ul>

	Authors will have the opportunity to submit a rebuttal to the reviews to clarify questions posed by program committee members.

<h4>As in previous years, student-authors of accepted papers will be able to apply for travel support to attend the conference.</h4>
<p class="text-justify">
	
	Application descriptions may also be submitted to the Poster and Demo Track whenever appropriate. This could be an alternative for authors from Industry unable to provide details on their application while getting relevant feedback from the semantic Web community.
</p>

<h3>Delineation from the Research and Resource Tracks</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
	Submissions may employ various methods (e.g. from software engineering, scientific methods - qualitative and/or quantitative, analytics) to understand in greater detail the deployment of semantic technologies and data (online or offline) or present novel practical approaches that are relevant to the deployment of semantics, but may not otherwise gain an outlet in the conference. Submissions to the Applications (Emerging, In-Use, Industry) Track should rely on a concrete implementation. We expect implementation details on the application or the tool / system / architecture being presented. In addition we expect evaluations according to measures/indicators that are relevant to the adoption of the application or the performance of the tool. However, papers presenting a research prototype where the main objective is to support the validation of a research hypothesis or answering a research question are more appropriate for the research track.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
	Papers presenting resources such as datasets, ontologies, workflows, software tools (descriptions of established software resources) or evaluation benchmarks, as important outputs of any scientific work, are more appropriate to the resource track.
</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Topics of Interest</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
	We invite the submission of original papers organized around some of the following aspects:
	<ul class="text-justify">
		<li>Description and analysis of concrete problems and user requirements for applying semantic technologies in a specific domain</li>

		<li>Descriptions of how Semantic Web resources (ontologies, datasets, software, etc) are being used in practice</li>

		<li>Analysis and evaluation of usability and uptake of Semantic Web tools and technologies</li>

		<li>Scalability analysis and large scale deployment</li>

		<li>Assessment of the pros and cons of using semantic technologies to solve a particular and practical problem</li>

		<li>Pragmatics of using or deploying semantic technologies in real-world scenarios</li>

		<li>Comparison of semantic technologies with alternative approaches that use conventional or competing technologies</li>

		<li>Learned lessons and best practices from deploying and using an application or service based on Semantic Web technologies</li>

		<li>Assessment of costs and benefits of implementing, deploying, using, and managing Semantic Web technologies</li>

		<li>Analysis of risks and opportunities of using Semantic Web technologies in organizations with respect to their businesses and customers</li>

		<li>Descriptions of alternative semantic technologies being deployed in practice</li>

		<li>Description of Semantic Web ontologies and/or datasets that are being widely used in practice</li>

		<li>Mobile apps based on semantic technologies that have substantial user base</li>

	</ul>

	The Semantic Web Applications (Emerging, In-Use, Industry) papers will be evaluated on their relevance to the track, rigor in the methodology and analysis used to reach conclusions, originality, readability, and usefulness to developers, researchers, and practitioners.
