<p class="text-justify">
	The ISWC 2016 Doctoral Consortium will take place as part of the 15th International Semantic Web Conference in Kobe, Japan. This forum will provide PhD students an opportunity to share and develop their research ideas in a critical but supportive environment, to get feedback from mentors who are senior members of the Semantic Web research community, to explore issues related to academic and research careers, and to build relationships with other Semantic Web PhD students from around the world.

	<br/><br/>

	The Consortium aims to broaden the perspectives and to improve the research and communication skills of these students.

	<br/><br/>

	The Doctoral Consortium is intended for students who have a specific research proposal and some preliminary results, but who have sufficient time prior to completing their dissertation to benefit from the consortium experience. Generally, students in their second or third year of PhD will benefit the most from the Doctoral Consortium. In the Consortium, the students will present their proposals and get specific feedback and advice on how to improve their research plan.

	<br/><br/>

	All proposals submitted to the Doctoral Consortium will undergo a thorough reviewing process with a view to providing detailed and constructive feedback. The international program committee will select the best submissions for presentation at the Doctoral Consortium.

	<br/><br/>

	We anticipate that students with accepted submissions at the Doctoral Consortium will receive travel fellowships to offset some of the travel costs.

<h3>Submission information</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
	We ask the PhD students to submit an 8 page description of their PhD research proposal. All proposal have to be submitted electronically via the EasyChair conference submission System 
	(<a target="_blank" href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iswc2016dc">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iswc2016dc</a>). 
	The proposal text must have at least 8 sections (some can be very short), addressing each of the following questions:

	<ol class="text-justify">

		<li><b>Problem statement:</b> What is the problem that you are addressing?</li>

		<li><b>Relevancy:</b> Why is the problem important? Who will benefit if you succeed? Who should care?</li>

		<li><b>Related work:</b> How have others attempted to address this problem? Why is the problem difficult?</li>

		<li><b>Research question(s):</b> What are the research questions that you plan to address?</li>

		<li><b>Hypotheses:</b> What hypotheses are related to your research questions?</li>

		<li><b>Preliminary results:</b> Do you have any preliminary results that demonstrate that your approach is promising?</li>

		<li><b>Approach:</b> How are you planning to address your research questions and test your hypotheses? What is the main idea behind your approach? The key innovation?</li>

		<li><b>Evaluation plan:</b> How will you measure your success - faster/ more accurate/ less failures/ etc.? How do you plan to test your hypothesis? What will you measure? What will you compare to?</li>

		<li><b>Reflections:</b> Why do you think you will succeed where others failed? Provide an argument, based either on common knowledge or on evidence that you have accumulated, the your approach is likely to succeed.</li>

	</ol>
</p>
