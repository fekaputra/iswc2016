<p class="text-justify">
	The ISWC 2016 Posters and Demonstrations complement the paper tracks of the conference and offer an opportunity for presenting late-breaking research results, on-going research projects, and speculative or innovative work in progress. The informal setting of the Posters and Demonstrations encourages presenters and participants to engage in discussions about the work. Such discussions can be invaluable inputs for the future work of the presenters, while offering participants an effective way to broaden their knowledge of the emerging research trends and to network with other researchers.

	<br/>
	<br/>

	We invite submissions relevant to the area of the Semantic Web and which address, but are not limited to, the topics of the Research Track; the Application Track; and the Resource Track. Technical posters, reports on Semantic Web software systems (free or commercial), descriptions of completed work, and work in progress are all welcome. Demonstrations are intended to showcase innovative Semantic Web related implementations and technologies, both in academia and in industry. 

	<br/>
	<br/>

	We explicitly welcome entries from the industry.  However, submissions for posters and demos should go beyond pure advertisements of commercial software packages and convey a minimal scientific contribution.

	<br/>
	<br/>

	<b>Authors of full papers accepted for the Research Track; the Application Track; and the Resource Track are explicitly invited to submit a demonstration.</b> The submission should be formatted as the other posters and demonstrations but must cite the accepted full paper and needs to include an explanation of its added value with respect to the conference paper. The added value could include: a) extended results and experiments not presented in the conference paper for reasons of space, or b) a demonstration of a supporting prototype implementation.

<h3>Submission Information</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
	Authors must submit a four-page extended abstract for evaluation. All submissions will undergo a common review process, including those related to already accepted full papers. For demonstrations, authors are strongly encouraged to include in their submission a link to where the demo (live or recorded video) can be found. They should also make clear what exactly will be demonstrated to the participants (e.g., what datasets will be used, which functionalities will be shown).

	<br/>
	<br/>

	All submissions must be made electronically via the EasyChair conference submission system: <br/>
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iswc2016pd">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iswc2016pd</a>

	<br/>
	<br/>

	Submissions must use the PDF file format and must adopt the style of the Springer Publications format for Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). Details are provided on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0" >Springer's Author Instructions</a> page. Submissions that exceed the page limit will be rejected without review. 
	For details on the HTML format, see the <a target="_blank" href="html-submission.html">HTML submission guide</a>.

	<br/>
	<br/>

	At least one of the authors must be a registered participant at the conference, and attend the Poster/Demo Session to present the work. The abstracts of accepted posters and demonstrations will be given to all conference attendees and published on the conference web site, but will not be published by Springer in the printed conference proceedings. They will, however, be compiled into a CEUR-WS Proceedings for easy Web retrieval and archival.

	<br/>
	<br/>

	Metadata for all successful submissions will be included in the conference metadata corpus. Detailed information about metadata creation will be provided with the acceptance notification of the successful submissions.

	<br/>
	<br/>

	As in previous years, student-authors of accepted papers will be able to apply for travel support to attend the conference.

<h3>Review Criteria</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
	All paper submitted to the Posters & Demos Track will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to the Semantic Web, originality, potential significance, relevance, and clarity. The purpose of the track is to allow the presentation of preliminary results to the community, provided that originality and significance of the contribution are ensured. Authors submitting a demo are strongly encouraged to include in the paper a pointer to the online demo or video of the application to be presented. The absence of a pointer will affect the overall evaluation of the paper.
