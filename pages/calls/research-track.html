<p class="text-justify">
	The International Semantic Web Conference is the premier venue for presenting fundamental research, innovative technology, and applications concerning semantics, data, and the Web.

	<br/><br/>

	In this track of ISWC 2016, we are looking for novel and significant research contributions addressing theoretical, analytical, empirical, and practical aspects of this broad field. While we welcome work that relates to the W3C Semantic Web recommendations (e.g., RDF, OWL, SPARQL, etc.), we encourage submissions that investigate other approaches to the intersection of semantics and the Web.

	<br/><br/>

	All papers will be assessed by a program committee. Each paper will be reviewed by at least four committee members, including one senior member. The review criteria used are outlined below. 

	<br/><br/>

	We also encourage authors to include pointers to additional material to substantiate the claims and findings discussed in their papers. Additional sources of material include extended technical reports, source code, datasets, as well as links to applications. Authors might consider submitting a separate paper describing these additional resources to the Resources Track.

	<br/><br/>

	Before submitting, authors are asked to consult the calls of the other tracks featured at ISWC 2016 and to choose the track that best suits their contribution. To produce a coherent conference program the track chairs may suggest transferring a submission to a different track of the conference with authors consent. However, the submission of the same work to multiple tracks is not allowed and may result in a rejection of the work across all tracks without a review.

<p class="text-justify">
	Papers in this track will be reviewed according to the following criteria:
	<ul class="text-justify">
		<li>Originality</li>
		<li>Relevance and impact of the research contributions</li>
		<li>Soundness</li>
		<li>Design and execution of the evaluation of the work</li>

<p class="text-justify">
	Authors will have the opportunity to submit a rebuttal to the reviews to clarify questions posed by program committee members. 
</p>

<!-- ################################################################################  -->

<hr/>
<h3>Submission</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
	Pre-submission of abstracts is a strict requirement. All papers and abstracts have to be submitted electronically via <br/>
	<a target="_blank" href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iswc2016">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iswc2016</a>.

	<br/><br/>
	
	All research submissions must be in English, and no longer than 16 pages. Papers that exceed this limit will be rejected without review. 

	<br/><br/>

	Submissions must be either in PDF or in HTML, formatted in the style of the Springer Publications format for Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). For details on the LNCS style, see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0" >Springer's Author Instructions</a>. 
	For details on the HTML format, see the <a target="_blank" href="html-submission.html">HTML submission guide</a>. 

	<br/><br/>

	ISWC 2016 submissions are not anonymous.

	<br/><br/>

	We encourage embedding metadata in the PDF/HTML to provide a machine readable link from the paper to the resource.

	<br/><br/>

	Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide semantic annotations for the abstract of their submission, which will be made available on the conference Web site. Details will be provided at the time of acceptance.

	<br/><br/>

	Accepted papers will be distributed to conference attendees and also published by Springer in the printed conference proceedings, as part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper there.
</p>

<h3>Prior Publication And Multiple Submissions</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
	ISWC 2016 will not accept research papers that, at the time of submission, are under review for or have already been published in or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference.

	<br/><br/>

	The conference organizers may share information on submissions with other venues to ensure that this rule is not violated.
