<h3>Award Details</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
	The exact amount awarded to each student will depend on depending on the needs stated in the application and the kind of submission that they have in ISWC 2016. Preference will be given to students that are first authors on papers accepted to the main conference or the doctoral consortium, followed by those who are first authors on papers accepted to ISWC workshops and the Poster & Demo session.

	<br/><br/>

	This year we will consider supporting travel companions for attendees with special needs. We are also considering offering support to help attendees who would necessarily incur childcare costs whilst attending ISWC and travelling with a child. If you have any questions, or would like to discuss your specific requirements please do not hesitate to get in contact with us.  If you have further questions please feel free to contact us ( <imail><span class="text-info"><span>iswc.travel.awards</span><span class="hmail">.193746</span><span>@</span><span>gmail.com</span></span></imail> ).
