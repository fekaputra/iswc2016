<p class="text-justify">
	ISWC is the premier venue for presenting innovative systems and research results related to the Semantic Web and Linked Data, attracting yearly a large number of high quality submissions and participants from both, industry and academia. ISWC brings together researchers from different areas, such as artificial intelligence, databases, natural language processing, information systems, human computer interaction, information retrieval, web science, etc., who investigate, develop and use novel methods and technologies for accessing, interpreting and using information on the web in a more effective way.

	<br/>
	<br/>

	Besides the main technical programme, ISWC will host a number of workshops on topics related to the general theme of the conference. The role of the workshops is to provide a context for a focused and intensive scientific exchange among researchers interested in a particular topic. As such, workshops are the primary venues for the exploration of emerging ideas as well as for the discussion of novel aspects of established research topics.

	<br/>
	<br/>

	We invite you to submit a proposal for workshops on a topic of interest to ISWC attendees. 
</p>

<hr/>
<h3>Review Criteria</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
	The decision on acceptance or rejection of a workshop proposals will be made on the basis of the overall quality of the proposal and its appeal to a reasonable fraction of the Semantic Web community.

	<br/>
	<br/>

	In particular, workshops should address topics which satisfy each of the following criteria:

	<ul class="text-justify">
		<li>the topic falls in the general scope of ISWC 2015</li>
		<li>there is a clear focus on a specific technology, problem or application</li>
		<li>there is a sufficiently large community interested in the topic</li>
	</ul>

	We look for two types of workshop proposals: 

	<ol class="text-justify">
		<li>established workshops on a specific aspect of Semantic Web Research that have demonstrated the ability to attract a high number of submissions and participants as well as a noticeable effect on the scientific progress in that particular field. Corresponding proposals will mainly be evaluated on past success. </li>

		<li>proposals for workshops on emerging topics that will become more important to the Semantic Web Community in the next years. Proposers will have to argue why the topic is of increasing importance for the community and  will attract enough submissions and participants to support the development of the topic. Proposals of this type will mainly be evaluated on the potential for future impact. </li>
	</ol>
</p>

<hr/>
<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
	<ul class="text-justify">
		<li>Title</li>
		<li>Workshop Type: established/emerging</li>
		<li>Abstract: 200 word summary of the workshop purpose</li>
		<li>Topics: What topics of interest will be covered by the workshop? (bulleted list, no longer than half a page)</li>
		<li>Motivation (emerging only): Why is the topic timely and of particular interest to ISWC participants? (one to three paragraphs)</li>
		<li>Past Workshops (established only): describe the development of the workshop series over the past 3-5 years. Provide quantitative information on submissions and attendance.</li>
		<li>Workshop Format: The intended mix of events, such as paper presentations, invited talks, panels, demos and general discussion (either a tabular schedule or a one paragraph summary)</li>
		<li>Audience (emerging only): Who and how many people are likely to attend? (one paragraph)</li>
		<li>Chair(s): Name, affiliation, email address, homepage and short (one paragraph) biography of each chair, explaining the chair's expertise for the workshop</li>
		<li>Program Committee: Names and affiliations of potential PC members (at least half of these should be confirmed at the time of the proposal)</li>
		<li>Length: Half-day or full-day?</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
	We strongly advise having more than one chair, preferably from different institutions, bringing different perspectives to the workshop topic. We welcome workshops with an innovative structure and a diverse programme which attracts various types of contributions and ensures rich interactions.

	<br/>
	<br/>

	Accepted workshops will be required to prepare a workshop web page containing their call for papers and detailed information about the workshop organisation and timelines. While the ISWC workshop-track and local chairs will assist with the local organisation of the workshop, the workshop organisers will be responsible for conducting their own reviewing process, for publicity of their workshop, and for publishing electronic proceedings. Moreover, at least one chair of each accepted workshop will have to attend the workshop in person.

	<br/>
	<br/>

	The chairs of each accepted workshop will receive one free registration (conference + one workshop/tutorial day) per workshop. Workshop attendees must pay the ISWC workshop registration fee as well as the conference registration fee. 

	<br/>
	<br/>

	Submissions will be made via easy chair at <br/>
