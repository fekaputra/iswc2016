<h1>{{ page.title }}, for PhD students, Postdocs and junior Faculty</h1>

<p class="text-justify">
  The Mentoring Lunch at the International Semantic Web Conference brings together graduate students and early-career researchers with experienced researchers from both, industry and academia for a lively discussion and question-answering session on a variety of topics. If you are a PhD student, a postdoc, or have just started an independent research career and would like to get advice on any of the round-table topics listed below, please join us at the specially designated tables 
  <b class="text-danger">on October 20th, 2016 (the room will be announced soon).</b> 
  Our mentors are all volunteers from the speakers, chairs, and other senior participants at the conference.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
  If you would like to get advice from mentors on some of the topics below, please
    
  <a target="_blank" href="http://goo.gl/forms/cE4x0WmMetC2FXJf2">register for lunch</a> 

  and answer a few quick questions that would help us with the organization of the lunch. The first 65 people to sign up will be automatically added to the list of attendees, the rest will be put on the waiting list (we are limited by the room capacity and by the number of mentors).
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
  While we are organizing only the mentoring lunch, we expect that some of you might want to have a more sustained relationship with the mentors and we invite you to ask the mentors at lunch about such a possibility.
